They are allowing sellers in China to claim their products are being sold by UK companies. Then, when your item does not arrive and you try and contact the seller you suddenly find the item is coming from China and you have no idea when it will arrive. Rather buy from Argos.","March 11, 2021"

We had been experiencing issues surrounding our listings for 2 and a half months, regarding issues that were CAUSED by Amazon themself. They always say they are contacting the internal team for more information, which really just means they don't know how to fix the issue and no longer wish to assist you. After hearing the ""We are here to assist you"" on there phone line for the 100th time this year, I no longer wish to ever sell/buy from Amazon again.","May 24, 2023"

The installer showed up with instructions to only install one of the tvs - when I called Amazon customer services about it they stated that they cannot override the install of the second tv in my request and they would have to do a second appointment for the second tv, even though the installer is already here installing the first tv.  They confirmed it was not a 3rd party installer, it was one from Amazon.  They only way for them to complete my original order was to have the installer leave and come back another time.","December 30, 2021"

When I was an Amazon delivery driver, I made sure I followed all instructions that the customer left because I know if it was my package and it’s not where it was suppose to be i would be majorly upset, and I was! Because I have a lot of porch pirates, I descriptively ask for them to leave behind my home. Sometimes they lie and put that they did but take a picture of my front door. Like this is crazy. And because I reported it 4 times, they decided to close my account. To me they are losing business at the expense of their delivery drivers.

Just a few minutes before end of the due for no reason my orders canceled. I understand this issue could be happen. But the main problem is Amazon doesn't care about how is the costumers feeling. I tried to tell them my complain is about  my time. Amazon waist my time and I need my orders, although they try to make me happy with 5 dollars credit offer. I said this is insulting whenever people talk about humanity and customers respect, but the still tried to buy my waist time with 5 dollars gift card. I just disappointed because feels like Amazon already grows up and don't need to respect or responsibility about customers. Even Worse than that is costumer services that act like robot or some technology without any understanding. I recommended to send me my order after at least another two hours chat with costumer service but they passed me to the other person and it repeated several times and each time they asked me to explain again my story. I know billion dollars corporation don't even look at our rights but I'm sure where ever any system ignore humans they will fall in the end. For my part, I will close my Amazon account forever.

For some reason in the packed parcel the new tool was replaced with an old one. I returned the parcel, but I never got my money back. I decided to keep using amazon for small and inexpensive purchases. Now I was buying toys for children, and I was not surprised when instead of two toys in one set I received one, and the box from the set was missing. The parcel envelopes were not damaged, it was done by those who packed the goods in the parcel envelopes. What should I do now? I cannot return the parcel as it is part of the set and not the complete set. I didn't take any video when opening the parcels. So, anyway, I am wrong with this amazon policy :) Of course, the parcel is inexpensive, maybe the seller would be willing to resend it to me, the missing part of the set. Buying something through amazon is like going to a casino :))))About custom service. Requested a call, I got a call from a robot who never managed to find my parcel part of which I received. It is very convenient not to record such a case in your system. It turns out that the complaint is kind of cold.","July 23, 2023"

And I get why they do it as there is millions of dollars that they get to hold on to of people's money while you wait to process an order that's never going to ship and then go through the process in order to get a refund from Amazon. They obviously know about it and are continuing that process. So in the end you may or may not get any product you order from them and if you don't get the product they will certainly put you through all the steps in order to get your refund while they're hanging on to your money. This is become an ongoing issue with them ordering product, being told it's been delayed, waiting, waiting, waiting and then being told it's not going to arrive at all. I'm sure they're making millions of dollars a month off of consumers who don't track their orders or at the very least being able to hold on to consumers money for quite some time while they continue to delay and order that's never going to actually come. It's obviously their choice what vendors they allow to list on their site and in the end they're making their problem our problem and trying to speak to somebody from Amazon about it is absolutely impossible. So buyer beware Amazon is becoming the new Facebook marketplace.","March 08, 2023"

It is the worst.,"I have been an Amazon customer for over 20+ years.This past season I decided to join the AMAZON Prime membership.WOW, What a mistake that was. They charge you $ 99 for slowing down your shipments.here are some examples of the ""service"" you get from Prime:They REMOVE other methods of shipping and only show ""Prime Shipping"", which is TERRIBLE.  There are no options for ground shipping, nor are there options for overnight shipping.  So, if you need something fast, do not join prime because that option disappears.Placed an order on a monday, with 2 day amazon Prime, which told me that it would be delivered on friday. (So much for 2 days). So, I make an appointment on saturday to have the items installed.At 9:30pm friday night, I get a message that my 2 days shipment placed 5 days ago was further delayed. So, I now had to go and cancel my appointment, which cost me a $ 50 dollar cancelation fee.  Item showed up saturday @ 9:40pm.  So, 2 day shipping on an order placed on a monday gets delivered @ 9:54pm on saturday night. And for that honor, it cost me $ 99 Prime fee, and another $ 50 fee because Prime did not perform as they promise.Place another order. No option for next day shipping, just ""Prime Shipping"".  Same thing happens. Order place on Monday. Says it will be delivered on wednesday.  Make an appointment to have the item installed.  Same thing happens.. Get a message wednesday night that the package is ""delayed"", and won't be delivered until friday or maybe saturday. (They are not sure).So, I contact what they call Prime customer service, which is basically just a chat room.  They are useless and then try and insult you with a $ 5 dollar ""coupon"" for them not performing.  At this point, I cancelled my Prime membership and will vow never to buy another thing on Amazon that I need quickly. I have no idea why the options for shipping methods was removed from their listings.  I'm not sure that these options were removed because I was a prime member, or if they were just removed across the board.In closing, if you need anything from Amazon that needs to be in a specific place at a specific date, you will be sorely disappointed. I have resorted to other sites that actually have more shipping options, and in some cases cheaper than amazon.If you are considering Amazon Prime, please note that they delay these orders and you will NOT get the orders as promised. I have placed 35 orders with Amazon since november and 20 of them were late, or in some cases, lost entirely.","February 08, 2021"

In the last couple of months, Amazon drivers appear to be allowed to get away with the same lies that cowboy courier services indulge in, which is claiming that a delivery has been attempted when they have not bothered to knock, or follow simple instructions on the delivery notes. This has now happened with my last two orders in a row. High value items? Forget it. The new 'one time passcode' protocol is nothing but hassle every single time - if you live in an apartment, or flat, these are the orders that the drivers are most likely to lie about attempting to deliver and will simply walk away without trying (all for the cause of avoiding actually having to come to your door, or even calling you on the phone to come down and collect). If they can't dump it in reception they'll simply leave the premise without trying and lie on the tracking. Whether it's drivers lying, or system problems with Amazon that mean the driver is unable to accept your code, it's an absolute headache every time. I'm still waiting for my recent order - the driver lied about attempting to deliver yesterday. I called Amazon who scheduled a redelivery for the next day. However, last night my parcel was put out again for evening delivery (unbeknown to their system or tracker) - the driver actually came to my door this time. However, due to an Amazon customer service rep organising the redelivery for the next day, the 'one time passcode' was no longer active and the driver was not able to hand me my parcel. What a joke - the parcel was right there but they refused to hand it over due to system errors and outright confusion. The standard of driver behaviour and quality of service has clearly taken a massive nosedive. Amazon Prime have now lost a loyal customer - no chance in hell I'll ever order a high value item from them again.","February 08, 2023"

Typically the drivers will knock or ring the doorbell to notify me that the packages have been delivered and will put it to the side of the door or on the chair next to my front door. NOTE: I have a storm door and external front door. The storm door has a solid bottom, meaning I have ZERO visibility of my front step and since the door swings outward, you have to step out to get it to swing fully outward and exit the home.  However, I hadn't received any knock, doorbell ring, text, or any other notification that the package was delivered, so when I went to step outside of my home around 8PM that evening, my foot ended up right inside of the package which caused me to fall, twisting both legs and causing two sprained ankles, strained knees and hips, and contusions to my knee and ankle. I struggled to get up, but was able to do so with the help of my daughter who came running when she heard the fall. After she got me inside and I was able to get things cleaned up and while waiting for my friend to bring larger bandages so I wouldn't bleed all over my home, and for my daughter's Grandmother to come to my home to take me to the ER since I couldn't put ANY weight on my left foot, I decided to call Amazon customer support to report what had happened. The agent on the other line was apologetic, and advised that she would get in contact with the shipping team, and began asking me questions such as if I felt the driver did it on purpose. I told her I don't think they did it maliciously, but, their negligence in not notifying me that the package was there, and putting it directly up against the step/in front of my door caused injury. I was asked to send in photos so I sent in pictures of the injury, videos of the fall and the delivery driver showing he just dropped the package and walked away taken by my security camera, and photos of my ER visit. I have been asking people repeatedly about what they plan on doing about this situation since I shouldn't be out hundreds, potentially thousands of dollars for an ER visit because one of your drivers didn't do their due diligence to notify the customer of the delivery. I have received nothing but half-hearted sympathetic emails in response with zero action save for the slap in the face refund for the $30.00 package whose contents were miraculously okay, and I didn't ask for a refund on.. Because that $30.00 order is going to cost me much more than that due to medical bills even after insurance coverage, and weeks, if not months of healing since sprains take a long time to heal. As a single mom, I sincerely doubt I can afford a legal team to combat Amazon and their customer service agents into covering medical costs that are destroying my budget, but, I feel that it was necessary to make sure people know just how far Amazon has fallen in relation to their delivery and customer services. I made one last ditch effort to try to see how we can make this right, because I do not feel it is fair that I have to suffer the burden of medical bills caused by no fault of my own, but their corporate team hasn't responded back. It has been a week now and I have received zero positive resolution.","October 16, 2019"

Website is part of the problem.,"Never had a problem with Amazon in the US but I now suspect that was because things never went wrong. Their international shipping and foreign websites are another story because more problems are encountered which their websites and customer service aren't dealing with effectively. I think the sites are evolving as features seem to change. First, the international shopping feature on the US site had issues when I last used them. At least to Mexico. They claim hassle-free shipping and refunds if things don't arrive on one web page but their agreement page states that the buyer is responsible for customs fees and shipping. Confusing and contradictory if not a legal loophole and certainly not 'hassle free"". They claim that entering a foreign address for delivery will only allow sale of items that can be mailed to that address. I have had 3 failed deliveries due to orders blocked by Customs. Secondly, their problem resolution via web pages and customer service is difficult, time-consuming and at times ineffective. On one occasion I spent 5 weeks of wrangling for a refund over a $600 order which Amazon Mexico reported had been lost in the (Mexican) mail system. After 5 weeks I gave up on Amazon and went to my credit card company which immediately issued a refund that wasn't contested by Amazon. (Note that refunds of Amazon purchases from third-party vendors are discretionary since they are not coveted by the same rules as direct purchases). Both US and Mexican site had no way of requesting a refund for a lost package. Their AI interface restricts selections and the one page which comes up with a button for lost packages brings up a previous page to repeat an endless and futile cycle. The only page that allows unfiltered contact to customer service is at the very bottom of the first displayed when you select the 'contact customer service"" link on the US site. The Mexican site doesn""t allow unfiltered contact. Perhaps Amazon needs to pay heed to the message on their customer service feedback at the end of customer service messages, noting that feedback is helping them construct the 'most customer-centered business on earth.' There are no customer service email addresses or telephone numbers displayed on the Amazon web pages. They can be found for the US and Mexico by doing a web search. Customer service (CS) were always polite and often helpful. However, on one occasion a lost package in Mexico suggests significant chaos and inattentiveness. An ongoing problem isn't followed up by a single person, even when I replied to the specific, numbered email address of the CS representative who emailed me. On each of 5 occasions the reply was from a different individual who, in each case promised that they would personally take care of the problem. I also called a few times and the CS representatives who answered always asked for time to review the case and get back to me, suggesting there wasn't an easily accessible record of the problem or any progress to resolve it. There is a message system embedded in your account information that I wasn't even aware of until a CS representative told me and provided a link. It took a few more days to find a link to it through the Amazon web pages. You can find it by selecting the 'my account' menu. It depends on the app where you will find it on the congested page which is displayed. On some apps it is displayed in the 'My Account' menu. It is an easy way to pick up and reply to messages from vendors but is 'read only' for Customer Service, once again foiling any option of continuity for an ongoing problem. Amazon Mexico fails to correctly identify mail carriers in Mexico, doesn't always update tracking information and later deletes all carrier information. One package was delivered by FedEx, with a FedEx label. My Amazon Mexico order details identified the carrier as Estafeta and provided a tracking number which the Estafeta tracking page said was invalid. My Amazon pages correctly tracked the package and when I used the tracking number on the FedEx tracking, it was accepted and gave identical information to Amazon and more. The expensive lost package was also reported as carried by Estafeta, but with an invalid tracking number. I couldn't check the number on FedEx pages because Amazon had deleted the tracking information from my order details. WHY??? In another case I followed up with a third party vendor on an internationally shipped order through Amazon US because it was a couple of weeks late. Amazon tracking information hadn't changed over the 2 week, indicating that it had 'left the carrier facility in Mexico City'. The vendor reported that a delivery had been attempted and also noted that it was better to track on the carrier's website as Amazon was notoriously poor at updating tracking information.And yes, this account reports Only my own experiences - over about the last six months","November 03, 2019"

She claimed that I couldn't talk to anyone except herself as she was the top of the management team so no one was above her.  She was not helpful and very rude.  She didn't help but hung up on me.  Though Amazon is a fast growing company, it is a long run for Amazon to learn and   provide good services to customers.

My packages are addressed to a private mail center that closes at a certain time. I indicated the business hours on the delivery instructions...which apparently are not read. I have received notifications of attempted deliveries...AFTER the business closed. I have had to call Amazon more times during the last 3 months, than I have since I have been a Prime member.

Amazon driver did not buzz my unit, so we had no way of knowing he is coming. Next, instead of going upstairs and leave package beside our door, driver left the box in the lobby of 12 story building and left. Now Amazon says they delivered to the correct address (lobby that is, I don't live in the lobby of 12 story building). So, we have no cameras in the lobby, package was stolen. I didn't know about that delivery until the next day, Amazon didn't send any notifications of delivery nor emails so when I accidentally opened Amazon website to check if my product was shipped it said DELIVERED!!! I ran downstairs to the lobby, obviously there was nothing because it's Wednesday and delivery date was yesterday on Tuesday. Now Amazon says open police report, we did that 18 days ago, police report have been concluded but Amazon says they can't reach police to check the case. I emailed police department and got response within 24 hours. Amazon representative with Indian name and English worse than mine said he can't reach police department they aren't answering phone. Imagine that heh a Vancouver police department in a city of 3 million people doesn't answer phone calls :) I emailed again saying maybe email them like I did, Amazon have not replied yet.

I kept receiving messages the delivery was running late until I received a message I should ask for a refund. Why didn’t the refund it automatically I never understood but now I do.To ask for a refund you have to return your item. How can I return something I never received ? The only option is cancelling the delivery (even if it’s days late) and it can be cancelled by the seller (Amazon) or the client, since I was not the seller I had to do it as the client. After that I could only ask for a refund. I called before and I was told that was the method.  By chat the representative told me the item was going to be “delivered tonight” and I asked “you mean in the next 4 hours because it’s already 8pm” and the answer was yes.The following day after not receiving the item I did what I was told. I couldn’t wait longer because I was visiting the US and was flying back to my country. The strange thing is that they told me it was “undeliverable” which is impossible because I was staying in a 5star hotel with 24/7 service and front desk receiving packages. Amazon sent me a code to be given when delivered and I gave it to the hotel. They never arrived to deliver anything nor requested a code. I confirmed that with the hotel. But it’s funny because in 6 days I received at least 10 other orders from Amazon, never missed or lost 1 single order. So “undeliverable” was not accurate.It’s April 12th and still haven’t received anything, the watch or the refund. They told me it was undeliverable and then they told me it was damaged but “since you cancelled the delivery” now I have to wait 30 days for it to be returned to Amazon for my refund.It was never in my hands and I cancelled because they told me to do it but now it’s their excuse for having me wait until they decide.Meanwhile I have had to pay the bank for the USD 450 charged to my credit card.I have chatted 4 times and talked over the phone 1 time with Customer Service Representatives, this lady whose name is Cha. She was rude, arrogant and 0 willingness to help.. just told me I have to wait 30 days and that’s it. I asked if I can talked to somebody else and she told me she was going to hang the phone… 2 times.What can I do ? It’s impossible to get to Amazon, nobody understands the issue.I am responsible for whatever Amazon sold, they decided which carrier to use, they didn’t deliver the order, haven’t sent it back yet BUT everything is about me. They have already charged me but won’t give the money back.A disaster. They work well with sells under USD 300 but more than USD 300 just beware.I have the terrible feeling I won’t see my USD 450 back. Very bad Amazon !!","March 23, 2023"

And that since the return label sent by the company is unusable that it is my responsibility to pay for the shipping at a cost of around $200 and since the label is unreadable, I do not even have the address to send it to. So Amazon get a 1 Star on this. I have also found that Amazon is a pro at giving you the responses you want to hear without really doing anything.You can go to Amazon and see the photos cannot up load photos here.","September 01, 2023"

Sometimes you get a good rep to help rectify it, but many times not so much. They have the help feature locked down so tight, it's hard to get to someone unless THEY think you need to talk with someone. THEY will be the judge, because the customerdoesn'tknow if they need help. I recently had a return. It has been 11 days and they still haven't received it. They state on their website it can take in total like 30 days to receive and process a credit.... That is to start. That's terrible. I tried to call and ask them what was happening with it, but they have it locked down and won't let you call. THEY don't think I need to call. The last and final straw was when they posted a message on my account saying I can no longer review any items I purchase. Apparently there is some kind of suspicious activity!?! They said my two reviews triggered it. First review on a butter dish ..I stated everything was great except the lid fell off too easily. ( In other words, the snap on lid doesn't work....But I didn't say it like that. I was actually nicer). The second review they told me was unacceptable raved about how great the trimmer cut my poodles hair. It I referenced my old model that was corded, which I do like, but the cord just got in the way. That's why I bought this one...the cordless. I Also talked about how it was more quiet, which was a plus for poodles. Suspicious? That's ridiculous. I tried to contact them and discuss the mistake they made, but they refer you to an email that they will never answer. If I did something wrong, they could tell me whst it was because I hadn't broken any of their rules that I read. I am done... Canceling my Prime membership and will be deleting my account when my paid Prime is up at the end of the month. They don't care about their customers. Amazon....you're not the only business out there. Many businessesare competing with you and doing pretty good at it. If you don't treat your customers fair and respectful, someone else will be happy to. Everyone one who sells THROUGH you that I buy from has their own website.

Multipurpose Kitchen Rolls,"I'm not typically one to voice complaints or write reviews, but I felt compelled to do so in this instance. This marks the second time I've ordered these rolls at £16.15 per pack of six, and regrettably, both times they arrived in a damaged condition. Given that these were intended for food-related use, I had to discard the initial batch as they were fused to the plastic packaging, which I suspect was due to moisture.Hoping for a resolution, I decided to give Amazon another chance and reordered the rolls, but my optimism was misplaced. They arrived once again in a damaged state, with the same issue and an additional rip in the plastic packaging.However, the most disheartening part of this experience was the interaction with the customer service agent. Their demeanor was exceptionally rude, condescending, and arrogant. They didn't allow me the opportunity to explain what had occurred, instead choosing to rant and abruptly ending the call. It was truly an abysmal encounter.Today's service did not reflect anything remotely ""Prime,"" so I have decided to cancel my Prime membership and will not be shopping in-store either.I've wasted two days waiting for deliveries and more time on the process of returning the item. My suggestion would be to save your time and consider purchasing your kitchen rolls from a different source.My review was deleted twice, and despite assurances of a manager's contact weeks ago, there's been no call or message. They denied any issue exists, which seems untrue.I've noticed they persistently ask for reviews but delete them if they're negative, especially for their own brand products.

Seems you cant be honest about your experience and quality of a product and seller. Bought a Corona Furniture  4 Door Arch Top Wardrobe.Quality 0 out 10. Dented, scratched, damaged, whole thing not square. Pre drilled holes in wrong place, gaps as wood not long enough at front and rear. Instruction book but none of pieces of wood labelled so like a massive jigsaw puzzle. Mercers did say they would replace damaged pieces or could return. (They obviously do not check quality of products and leave it to whether buyer will complain, ask for refund etc)I Explained I'm disabled, suffer mental health due to a mental breakdown and i  am not well, also offered to supply proof if they needed( blanked my messages). I had to pay someone to assemble as cannot do myself, they followed the Instruction pamplet step by step but pieces didn't fit as holes in wrong places, so could not use all the dowels. They wanted pics of rear of wardrobe but again explained I'm disabled and against wall.Ignored what i was saying and kept saying disassemble, box up and make appointment  to be collected. I couldnt cope, got upset to point of tears that I said I'd keep as found the whole process extremely upsetting and take money off. I Provided pics of damage, the unit not square,with pics of spirit level showing not straight. Images of doors misaligned, 4 shelves not straight with images of spirit level showing, images of damage, dents, scratches, gaps and they offered £15 off £350 cost with finance. Amazon didn't least amount they could to help and it seemed the whole thing was in sellers favour. I then got an offer of £25 off. I should also add the doors don't stay shut are higher than one another, from the left side going to the right, starts off flush and as it goes to other end gap starts and gets bigger and bigger ending in 2 to 3 inch gap. Photos provided and Amazon refused my first review, 2nd in review. Buy at your own risk, I explained to Mercer's that it had me in tears, affected my mental health, couldn't go through process of having to pay again to be dismantled and returned. They didn't show one bit of care, no empathy. Worst experience I've ever had to deal with to get money knocked off. I'm stuck paying for a year for a piece of rubbish at cost of £325.","October 14, 2023"

Now you want us to pay for MUCH more and you RARELY make next day delivery. So someone tell me why have an Amazon Prime Account? I'm buying more from private sellers than ever too - so why not just make full move to eBay and other selling sites? It's as if Amazon assumed we'd accept changes needed during real hard times of Covid. I now want next day delivery on Prime items AND you continue the removal of decent Prime free to watch items there's 2 accounts here definitely walking! Don't start me on the Echo. There's 4 in this house all different versions. One of the first leading to the latest. Other than sound quality the mic is crap and it's as if it's not connected to a search engine. Echo knows near nothing and it's clearly getting worse.If you're contemplating smart speakers or wanting to upgrade - get cheap Google nest things and then connect a decent speaker. If I bin my Spotify account then I'm selling my echoes.

I have two Grandchildren who are US citizens and they all live happily in Florida.I have made four attempts to purchase a US$50 Amazon Gift Card for my Granddaughter, all of which have been declined by Amazon, which has requested I change my payment method, which I have done, using both a credit card and a debit card. The problem is that Amazon is only interested in me purchasing the gift in £Sterling!Newsflash Amazon: Florida is in the United States of America where the currency is the US Dollar!I have no doubt Amazon wants me to purchase a £Sterling Amazon Gift Card so that, whenever my 11 year old Granddaughter uses it, they can rip her off with some usurious rate of exchange. The current rate was $1.35,  but the Amazon rate was £1.30, which is an obscene margin!So folks, anyone thinking about purchasing from Amazon for Grandchildren who live overseas, forget it, unless you to be ripped off!","December 06, 2020"

I was attempting to access my account to make a purchase, and upon reaching the login page and entering my credentials, the following message appeared: ‘Your account has been terminated for improper use of Amazon services. We have sent you an email with more information.’ (It was written in Italian, I translated it with Google translate). However, no email arrived in my inbox despite repeated attempts. I began searching online to see if anyone else had encountered the same issue. I found an email address where I could file a complaint. They responded stating: ‘as already communicated to you, we have closed this account. From our records, we have previously terminated your account for violating the terms of our user agreement. Following termination of your account due to breach of contract, you are not permitted to open a new account or use another account to place orders on our site. Following a thorough evaluation, we have decided not to restore your full access to this account. It will therefore not be possible for you to place orders on our site. Any digital content purchased with this account is still available to you. To access the content, click the Manage content and devices link in the My Orders menu on Amazon.it.’ Despite my attempts to seek clarification, they provided the same generic responses, failing to explain the exact reason for the account termination and how I violated the terms of the agreement. Furthermore, they mentioned that I could still access digital content purchased with the account, which was untrue since my account was closed, leaving me without access to anything.Adding insult to injury, I own a Kindle that was linked to my account. A few days later, I attempted to read a book on my Kindle. As I am Russian and my Amazon account is Italian (and all the books in the Amazon store are either in Italian or English), I purchase eBooks from Russian websites and download them via USB from my PC to my Kindle. However, that night when I opened my Kindle, it was EMPTY!!! All my books were gone! And on the screen was the login page to the Amazon account, which I no longer had access to. Here arises an interesting question: how did they learn that my account was closed if my device was not connected to Wi-Fi? This implies that Amazon has another means of controlling my data and my device. All the books I downloaded, all the notes I made in the books, all the progress I made (I usually read several books at the same time) - everything was gone! An empty Kindle!!!I am deeply disappointed and angry with the situation and feel utterly helpless in resolving this problem. My account was canceled without explanation, I cannot ask questions through the app's customer service as my account is closed, Amazon support has ceased responding to my emails, my Kindle books have been deleted, and there is no one who seems to care or can offer assistance in any way to address this issue.","February 28, 2024"

I order products through a drop ship wholesaler who represents hundreds of manufacturers and over 13,000 products. Our wholesale outlet is one of the most respected in the country and purchases only from verified trademark holders for redistribution. Because of the numbers involved, the manufacturers might not know my name. However, I have an account in good standing with the wholesaler. I list my products on Amazon by means of a data feed directly from the wholesaler. Occasionally a manufacturer/trademark holder may grow concerned about counterfeit products offered on Amazon and submit blanket complaints about every retailer they see on Amazon whose name they do not recognize. This happened to me. When this happens I immediately contact the wholesaler to ask for a letter of verification and an introduction to the manufacturer/trademark holders as proof that I sell products sourced only from the trademark holder - not counterfeits. I also request and receive letters of verification from the manufacturer/trademark holder. At Amazon's request I also submitted invoices from the wholesaler to show that I purchase products from the legitimate source. These letters and invoice are attached as Exhibits to this complaint. Once these documents have been submitted Amazon stopped communicating with me. All I received were automated e-mails stating that I need to submit the documents I already submitted. Using automation Amazon repeats the same complaint and document request over and over ignoring the documentation sent to them. After several automated e-mails, Amazon stopped replying altogether. After several weeks of sending automated e-mails Amazon suspended my account and held the funds for the sales I had already completed. The unpaid balance due to me is $312.68. When I requested the release of the funds, Amazon sent one automated e-mail saying I could expect a response in 7 days. I contacted them again after 14 days and received an automated response saying Amazon will not release the funds, they will not provide the reason and will no longer communicate with me. The customer paid me, not Amazon,for the merchandise I delivered. This money does not belong to Amazon. The maneuver of not transmitting to me the proceeds of my sales does not seem to be even legal. The use of robot e-mail replies on Amazon's part hints to my mind at fraudulent intent.Additional Information: I believe this process of (1) Accusing a seller of wrongdoing (2) Ignoring a seller's defense (3) Holding the seller's balance due presumably for be kept as Amazon's personal business property - this process is a generalized fraudulent scheme. The basis for my belief is the number of complaints by sellers on Amazon who has voiced the same complaint.","October 30, 2019"

Yesterday, I wanted to find/buy a remote for my tv. Both Amazon and Walmart had the one I needed. I checked their prices and could see that Amazon's was ~$7 cheaper (after shipping). So for about 4 hrs I tried to buy it on Amazon. I gave up on trying and ended up buying it from Walmart after about a 4 hr period of failure, phone calls, and frustration. It took me 5 minutes to do the Walmart thing, so I ended up buying my remote there.The problem was:  I had just moved, and had gotten a new phone # (landline). I couldn't access my account. I wasn't even able to open a new account. The main problem was that I don't have a cell phone (they want to leave you a text with a sign in code). They emailed me some kind of instructions that didn't work - From what I could see, if you have a new address, a new phone number (landline), and you don't own a cell phone, you are a second class customer and will not be able to access  any existing account or even open a new one.

I was told i had to pay for it, but when the item arrived I was told to contact customer support again for a refund for the expenses of the express shipping. I was also told the chat would be stored so that i did not have to tell the whole story again. As this was promised to me, I aggreed to have the shoes sent another time, with express shipping. This time the item reached me as it was supposed to. I then contacted customer service again, but the person i got to talk to then, knew nothing about it. I had to explain everything all over again, and in the end I was told some other department or whatever had to handle it, and they would contact me within a day or so.

I was put in chat with first one person today, who sent me on to someone else in another department, that again left the chat so i had to start from scratch again with someone else for the 5th time. This person just telles me i was wrongly informed and they will not refund me anything. I used to think Amazon was a deasent company, and I was really not happy to be hustled like that. I have saved the entire chat history and can document everything, but when someone at their company has told me something wrong, they still let me as a customer be the looser. What happened to ""we are sorry, of course you'll have the refund, there must have been a misunderstanding on our behalf""?Never shopping at Amazon again, and i strongly recomant the same for everyone else.

Was not due to be delivered for 8 days. Tried to cancel the order 3 minutes after it was placed. Couldn't do it, as ""order was processing"". Had a chat session with CS, who told me to wait for status to change to ""Dispatch"" so that I could contact them again and cancel.Status changed to ""dispatch"" today (3 days after ordering). Contacted again CS and was told an order cannot be cancelled once dispatched. I should just reject delivery due in 5 days...which I usually can't since they dump parcels outside (and it will be a 20kg battery this time).Surely, if a (heavy) order takes 3 days to be dispatched and then 5 days to be delivered, it can be cancelled at some point without going onto a delivery truck, to be rejected or returned by me.Also, they keep referring as ""external vendor"" when the good is coming from...Amazon EU.

The sticker on the top of the box said ""white"", but later when I packed it up to return it, I noticed the sticker on the bottom stated ""black"". So,I called and asked to exchange it for the color that I ordered.That's when the problems began.I spoke w/4 supervisors in the hopes that one of them would be helpful in resolving the issue, but to varying degrees,I was met with disrespect, suspicion,condescending attitude, and downright talking over me.Quite honestly, I've never experienced this from Amazon,... ever...until now.Something has changed, and not for the better.To complicate matters, mine was sold through their warehouse as "" like new"" and they didn't want to help me get the color I ordered...even though it was their error.I guess they fail to check to be sure these boxes contain the item as described, although their descriptions online would lead you to believe they do. I was told I would be refunded only if I followed their online instructions to a T and if I wanted the white one I could go back and purchase it at the current price which is now higher. No apologies, no ""let's see if we can correct this error"", no... actually, one supervisor questioned whether I did receive the wrong color, Ugh...  (that theory was debunked once she saw the photo and the invoice).Because the correct color was now going to cost more as it's price moved up and down like the stock market while I waited for my package to arrive, I decided to just cut my loses of time and energy and get my money back.Amazon, it appears does not value their customers.Because of the horrible treatment, waste of hours on the phone,the stress I endured, and the lack of respect and value for a long standing Prime member, I decided I had enough, and plan to cancel my membership and stop ordering from Amazon altogether.","October 10, 2023"

Customer Service of no help.,"Today I was reconciling my bank account and discovered a charge made against it from Amazon. My last order was placed several days ago and all charges were paid in full. This was a mystery. So I contacted ""customer service"" via ""Chat"" and ""Prerna"" of ""Customer Service"" brushed the issue off by telling me ""I'm sorry but if you want details so I request you please contact the bank to this they will provide you details."" I checked the on-line invoice for the order referenced. There's no mention of the extra charge but the money certainly has been taken from my account. Mystery charges and no responsibility for explanation. Buyers beware.I'm investigating with the ""bank"" and will be following up with Consumer Protection because there was no authority given for any ""additional"" charges to be made against me.I'll up-date as I learn more.Up-Date: June 2020The previous matter was some-what settled, almost a month later, with the issuance of a refund of the extra charges but my ""1-Star"" remains because, subsequently, on a rather large order, Amazon came through again with greater reason not to be trusted. That resulted in over 50$ in ""over-draft"" fees on my account! What they did was charge my debit card immediately when I placed the order (which they claim they do not do... a lie), then ""refunded"" the charge the next day. Ah... the following day they charged the full amount again (order still not shipped) and then AGAIN, the NEXT day they charged me. Double-charged. The double-charge resulted in every purchase/bill payment I made subsequently, to, effectively ""bounce""... to the tune of 55$ over-draft charges! I've NEVER had an over-draft on that account so when I explained it all to the bank, the only thing they could assure me of was that they understood the situation and that my reputation was still ""excellent"" with them. Meanwhile, it took many ""chats"" with Amazon, on-line AND informing them that I would take the matter to the local Attorney General as well as Consumer Protection/Affairs and social media. After about 2 days of being offered ""Promo Credit"" (which wouldn't pay the bills nor compensate for the cost of the fees which were their fault), the one double-charge was returned to my account and a day later, 50$ was also ""refunded"" to my account.Bottom line: Buyer Beware... be VERY aware. When using a debit card, CONSTANTLY check your account, daily if not twice daily, until your order is received. Maybe best to check after receipt as well. Amazon cannot be trusted. I never will trust them again.","March 12, 2020"

We were then charged $12.99 every month as well as my mother was still paying her membership. This did not make sense. Our card was not the primary card and both cards were being charged. In September we had had enough and emailed back and forth in order to remove the card and the charges with it. We then got a refund for all the months charged and we thought that was the end. Nothing came out in October so we really thought that was the then. November rolls around and they charged us TWICE in November for whatever reason of $1.99 and $12.99. The charges were about a week apart. The $12.99 charges started up again until I had enough when it over-drafted our account today as we have been tight on money and did not expect more charges from them (all the charges have come on different days AND the card is no longer on my mothers account so I never knew when it would come and why it was coming). So I called this time. And I left with more questions than answers. I explained as best I could. After questioning the last several times because her answers to my questions didn’t make sense (ex. I asked why our card was still being charged. She told me my husband had an account under his name and it was renewed. Well that’s a problem because 1. He’s never had an account. 2. We got new cards in May when this all started, how would it know to renew an account that was never there and the card was never put on file in that account?) Every time I would try and ask a question because things weren’t adding up I was talked over, but I talked back to get my question in. I gave up trying to get answers because I just want this problem solved and she clearly didn't/couldn’t/wouldn’t give me answers that made sense. So we cancelled this imaginary account and our card on it and she said it will not “auto renew again”. When I asked for her name she quickly muttered it so I’m not even sure what I wrote down was correct. She said an email was sent to my mothers email even though if my husband had this so called account wouldn’t she have HIS email? Whatever. Anyway I have still yet to receive the email confirming that the account was cancelled and our refund is coming. This whole endeavor has been frustrating and confusing and all I want is answers that MAKE SENSE and my money back. After all this, you better believe I and my husband are NEVER using Amazon again. I am so disgusted in how this was all handled.","January 09, 2020"

About a month ago, I contacted customer service because certain packages (heavy ones) were being delivered to my leasing office instead of my door. I was told the packages mentioned were being delivered by USPS, as amazon has a contract with them. I opened a case and voiced my concern, only to see no results. This past Saturday, my pets food was delivered to my leasing office and closed before I got off of work. I’d selected “leave at front door” during my order to avoid this issue. Of course, I got home to no package. I had to go out and purchase another food for my pets to hold them over until the office opened up Monday. Considering I’d already been assured this wouldn’t happen again, I was pretty upset. As not to be tied to the phone, I tried to use the customer service chat. Absolutely useless, I was told “I apologize for the inconvenience, I’ll pass along the feedback”. That’s fine, but at this point it’s more than an inconvenience. What is the point of paying $129 a year for a delivery service, to still have to drive somewhere, load up my own package, then carry it up 2 flights of stairs? If that was the route I wanted to take I’d save myself the $129 and go to the store myself. But see the reason I chose amazon is due to the odd hours I work, and the fact that I suffer from back and neck issues and have been advised against carrying heavy items. I decided to call, the man I spoke with couldn’t seem to understand why I was upset. I asked to speak to a supervisor, was left on hold for about 10 minutes, then told she didn’t have time to talk to me right then, but he would try to help. I repeated my concern again, and he then told me he didn’t understand why she wouldn’t help me and put my on hold again. A few minutes later, a male supervisor picked up. He said he understood my concern and presented me with options. He said he could file a request to have amazon deliver rather than usps. He then asked me if I’d written a letter to usps asking them to deliver mypackages to my front door. I’m sorry, what? Why should I have to do that? I select “deliver to my front door” and provide MY ADDRESS. That tells you that I want my packages delivered to my front door, regardless of the reasoning behind it. After all, isn’t that what I’m paying for? He told me that amazon is only responsible for making sure the packages arrive in 2 days, and how they’re delivered isn’t their responsibility. I explained that, yes, if they pay USPS on behalf of amazon, they are indeed responsible for it. At that point, I told him I felt like, after 45 minutes of arguing, and all the hassle, that I was entitled to some sort of compensation. I’ve been paying for a prime membership but still having to essentially deliver my own packages and purchase extra pet food when it’s delivered to the wrong place and I can’t get there until days after due to my work schedule. He said I couldn’t have any refund on my membership since it was an annual subscription. So I explained that he needed to find a way considering I was paying for a service I wasn’t getting. I suggested that instead, I get a refund for all of the items I’ve ordered that I had to retrieve myself...he put me on hold and said he could give me $63 dollars towards my membership. This is the worst experience I’ve ever had. I am researching other places to order my pets food from, as I do not wish to support a company who doesn’t deliver exceptional customer service. If a manager cannot make time to speak with an unhappy customer due to issues caused by their company, they should not be employed there. Amazon, you’ve lost a loyal customer. As soon as I find an alternative, I will certainly take my business elsewhere and make sure I inform others so they avoid the hassle.","October 28, 2019"

Customer service and their loyalty to the customer are a thing of the past.  Their people are spoiled little know-it-alls who are arrogant and actually know very little. Many Amazon representatives have very heavy accents, are difficult to understand, in many cases speaking broken English, lacking basic writing skills. This translates into people who cannot understand what you are calling about or how to help you. Amazon yet again ticked me off with more aggravating issues.  First was a problem with my Amazon 55"" Omni TV which recently started having additional software issues, this time with the picture setting Vivid. I called Amazon and explained the TV would not stay on the Vivid setting and kept going to Natural instead. This was never an issue in the past. Per their request I rebooted the TV, after, I unplugged the TV which still did not work. They then wanted me to reset the TV back to factory settings which I said I would not do as it would not fix the issue, the problem was on their end and that they needed to submit a ticket. The Amazon support person said they cannot until I reset the TV as requested. After over an hour, I advised I would just wait until someone else calls, then takes the hours to reset the TV for them to find out I was right. It only took two days for me to be proven right and the issue to be fixed. Next I wrote a product review for a shampoo and conditioner as follows, which was rejected by morons several times.Review: Title: Excellent product - highly recommend.Text: I developed a very itchy scalp from environmental allergies which was greatly exacerbated by another high end conditioner. Even when I stopped using it, the itch would not go away, even after several months. I read many reviews, found this conditioner along with the shampoo which was in a two pack. Love it. Stopped the itch completely, and it keeps it under control. Both the Shampoo and Conditioner smell great. I did receive a card in the mail from the manufacturer stating I would receive a small gift for leaving a honest review which I would have done without it, so it was just an additional benefit. Tip: In my opinion the conditioner goes faster, so we buy at least a couple of the combination pack, and then an extra one or two of the conditioner.Amazons reply: Hello, Specifically, I would like to draw your attention to the following guideline: -We don't allow content that advocates or threatens physical or financial harm to yourself or others. ------ review you posted (as listed above) the line we rejected for is ""Stopped the itch completely, and it keeps it under control."" Why we rejected ---1. Product work differently for every individual not same working for everyone.2. If you said it worked perfectly and we approved and if some another customer uses it and have harsh reactions , then that person will be in serious trouble.Note, my review is like millions of others giving their opinion. Amazon has dug in their heels. Their CEO and Executives are cowards who cannot and will not take the time to respond to the little people, instead their underpaid, low intelligence employees handle it. From this point on, purchasing from Amazon is only, and I mean only in on an emergency basis, such as for health issues where I cannot get the product anywhere else. From what I read I believe they already laid off around 10,000 employees, and I look forward to many more to come.  Amazon is very slowly becoming a thing of the past. A relative has Walmart+ and they are making inroads, getting better and better by the day. I will make sure to post my opinion on every website possible along with sending copies of the Amazon email to family and friends for a good laugh!","April 04, 2023"

My reasons are as follows. Amazon in the last couple years has been dealing with a lot of Chinese sellers. With that being said -a lot of the things that I have purchased personally on Amazon have come in a different color as advertised or a different size or just completely cheaply bottom-of-the-barrel made. Secondly, in the past month alone I have received four items from Amazon that have been damaged to the point of having to be returned. Thirdly, I pre-ordered an item about 3 weeks ago that didn't show up on the day it was supposed to. For the following three days the tracking status showed that the item would be there that day. Yesterday when I went my orders part of my Amazon account this particular item in red writing stated ""approval needed"". I had to call Amazon to find out what was going on. The gentleman in broken English proceeded to tell me that I needed to call so they knew whether or not to still send the item to me because it was not received on the day it was supposed to. What they were doing was requiring me to call and approve the purchase that I had already made. If I would have not called within a certain amount of time they would have canceled the item all together and not sent it to me. This was a high -in demand item at the time I ordered it. I have a feeling that they sold more than they had in their inventory and are now screwing people over. Whether I receive this item or not is yet to be determined. But, at the end of the day this was supposed to be a Christmas gift for my two year old that she will now not receive this Christmas. I would also like to add that I base a lot of my purchases from Amazon on the reviews.  But I have noticed that when I look at the reviews they are not even for the item that I am looking at purchasing! For example, I was looking at a phone case for my phone and low and behold 80% of the reviews were for a bath mat or a trash can liner. How does a company like Amazon fail so miserably at this? How can you have 5000 reviews for a product and only a small percentage of those reviews are for the actual product you were looking at? The two-day shipping is also a bit of a joke. People pay for their Amazon membership based on the sole fact that they are guaranteed the product that they purchase within two days. I can say that a huge amount of my purchases have been delayed. So if you are guaranteed a 2-day shipping turn around, that is what it should be, two days. Not 5, not 6, and not over a week. I also have not been notified of a delay in shipping of my products until the actual day they are supposed to arrive! Then all the sudden when I look at my orders page it says that it has a new ""expected delivery date"".  Disappointed in Amazon to say the least. They're quality control needs severe attention. They also need to stop getting greedy like Walmart and dealing with all Chinese sellers. It seems as though everything is getting to their head as once happened to Walmart. Greedy, greedy, and more greedy. As of the first of the year of 2019 I will be canceling my Amazon Prime membership permanently. Sorry Amazon, you have lost mine and my family's business for the reasons stated above plus more that I won't mention to not make this review any longer than it already has been","December 23, 2018"

As a Prime Member, Amazon did NOT make good on an order even though they didn't follow delivery instructions asked for at the time of order. As a result, and as a possible theft, Amazon did NOT provide a refund or replacement order even after completing every required step stated by reps. Beyond the financial loss, be aware most reps are hard to understand, don't listen, don't bother to refer to file notes (if there are any). They seem to use the same scripts not related to a question or to the information just provided. Example: I tried to explain the local police referred us to the Sheriff’s Office to file a possible theft report as they have the law enforcement jurisdiction at our rural address. No question or acknowledgement but repeatedly stating, “You must file a police report.” Finally, when I asked to speak to a supervisor, the rep hung up!  Also, as in my case, you will never speak to the same rep again. Even after your claim reportedly goes to “escalation,” you must call the general customer service number and start over, which includes reexplaining EVERYTHING as if it’s the first time you called.  Maddening! Still, I did EVERYTHING required, even repeatedly.  I was finally reassured by one phone rep that he saw my PDF report on file, that all had been done including talking to the USPS. He said our claim would be resolved quickly after he sent all to Escalation and not to worry about the deadline since we had completed everything required by that date. Yet on the “deadline date,” I called and spoke to 2 reps. I was told by the first rep after placing me on an extended hold, that he had called the police department and they had no record of a report from me on file, therefore there was nothing Amazon could do.  I again explained I had sent a PDF of a Sheriff’s Department report due to law enforcement jurisdiction as instructed by the local police department three times! He just repeated the same thing again with no acknowledgement of what I just said.  I begged him to listen and not hang up. I asked what ""police"" number he had called to verify he had called the Sheriff's Department; he said he couldn’t share that information due to privacy. I verbally stated the phone number of the Sheriff’s Department and asked if he had called that number - he wouldn't answer. I then asked to speak to his supervisor and was assured the supervisor would give me the same information he had. After an extended hold, someone new got on the phone. With a rude demeanor, he repeated that they had no police report on file; therefore, there would be no further support – refund or reorder. When I insisted it was there, again explaining that the jurisdiction was with the Sheriff’s office, he stated it did not contain all the information required. With witness at my side, I asked repeatedly for him to provide specifics of what was not included as I had referred to their email requirements, emailed those requirements to the Sheriff's Department, and saw the report with my own eyes, confirming all requirements met. He would not answer my question and provided no details. Finally, he said it was an “initial report” and not a “final report.” I told him this was the first I heard this as required to which he insisted they had provided me this information. Their email information had said to call Amazon during the police's office hours so their rep could verify information and I did this. (As soon as my call ended, I called the Sheriff’s Department myself and got immediately through. The gentleman in the report/records department told me no one from Amazon had called. They also said the rep doesn’t understand law enforcement investigations because if they don’t have a suspect as in my case, it is considered an open case with no final report written or available.) Bottomline: I have wasted significant time and effort – for nothing. I’ve taken a big financial loss on goods not delivered and paid at the same time a Prime Member fee to experience this type of treatment. (I also unfortunately ended up in the ER due to the stress of this all with heart issues.) Almost humorous, as you are on hold, Amazon’s recording speaks of their desire to have the best world class service. I am not a rude or unreasonable person. I used to be the Sr. V.P. in charge of customer service for a large company where we strived to protect the company but be fair with our customers. Trust me, Amazon's service is the worst. It’s inexcusable and I’m surprised there hasn’t been a class action lawsuit over inconsistent and unfair practices. Even if you’ve heard positive things about Amazon or you haven't had a problem yourself, just wait. Your turn may be coming. And it may be a horrific experience like mine.","December 14, 2023"

I was a member for over 13yrs! And I purchased a lot from your website! And of course with the pandemic my shopping habits picked up even more so. since I don’t get out much! Back in early spring I purchased an Apple Watch series 6 I believe I can’t recall right now. but I was sent the wrong series so immediately I contacted them and was told I would’ve to wait for a return approval since it was an apple product. well I waited and waited so I chatted online again with them and even called and I was told that the return label will be sent to my email! Tell me why Amazon kept the new watch and my money talking about I returned the wrong series even though they sent me the wrong series & were informed of this! I have screenshots of the conversations! But I have all intentions on taking them to small claims! They closed out my account because I was upset by the services I received so I simple printed off return labels of the last 14-20 days of purchases and they closed my account talking about “abuse of return” or “excessive returning” even though I didn’t even return the items that I printed off! They are crazy and I bet they sells dropped when I left because I was cashing in big time!!! but I’m actually happy that I don’t have to deal with them! I got tired of receiving broken items and packages getting lost in UPS system even delivered my package to my neighbors homes on a few occasions! Just poor services now I’m on to bigger and better things! but my point of my review is Yall need to be careful with Amazon they will send you the wrong item and pretend like You didn’t tell them what was going on before sending it back and they claim they have the right to keep your money and your return! And these scamming askes keep closing out my daughter account thinking it’s me! Even though we have different birthdates and phone numbers and IP addresses and email address!  And why would they say I can open a new account if they keep closing my daughter account? unless it’s a coincidence. I don’t want her dealing with them anyways. Oh yeah I tried to report them to the bbb for what they had pulled they lied and said they reason why my account was closed was because I was using used gift cards?! How is that even possible!? Never had I ever had a Amazon gift card before! The lady sounded dumb and lost! They are crazy if they think I’m going to let them get away with $750.00 dollars! It was the way they did it for me. Just unprofessional as ever!,"November 25, 2021"

We have been doing business with Amazon since late 2016, and had mostly satisfactory service from them until the pandemic happened. Our biggest problem is a failure to deliver products on time, if at all. For example. I was just informed for the 4th time in a single week that an order was going to be late, or as with the one I was just informed of, completely undeliverable. This used to happen on occasion, but now happens regularly. Dealing with customer service is just some customer service rep repeating a sentence, phrase or paragraph from the ""how to get rid of (choose your own descriptor) customer as quickly as possible with as little help/work as possible"" book they must all be handed the second they are hired. The second problem we regularly deal with, from day one, is receiving faulty, fake, knock-off, etc. products from ""big brand"" names, such as Energizer (entire 12-pack of CR2450 batteries that were bad), Wrangler (jeans that look like factory rejects, buttons sewed in wrong spot, horrible dye jobs), so on and so forth. That problem was easily solved, only order the cheap knock-off items from Amazon, that way you know what to expect. We order the name brand stuff from Walmart, and those orders rarely arrive late and/or in bad condition.We have tried to be understanding of the problems going on in the world, but we pay for the prime membership mainly for the free two-day shipping promises, and Amazon just cannot deliver on that any longer. Also, if they are able to pull my money immeditately upon ""placing order"", then I shouldn't have to wait 5 business days for a return of my $71 for an order that became ""undeliverable"" on the day it was supposed to be delivered. We cancelled the membership today, and decided to leave a review here, not necessarily to try to hurt Amazon, but to make future customers aware of problems they will likely run into.","March 13, 2023"

I then use the Security Code field to add . . 'DO NOT LEAVE IN RECEPTION' . . and in the 'Call Box' field I add the helpful suggestion 'DO NOT LEAVE IN RECEPTION' . . . and when I get an email from DPD/Amazon saying your parcel is on the way I add in the options 'DO NOT LEAVE IN RECEPTION', they then send a reply email confirming my choice, with a great big 'DO NOT LEAVE IN RECEPTION' in bold letters.So then the parcel actually arrives, the driver doesn't ring the bell or knock on my door, he just dumps the parcel in reception and leaves.This would be frustrating if it happened once, but it happens all the time, the only thing I can do is to pay a local cab company to come to my flats, I let them in via the intercom and they look for the parcel, and if they find it before the local kids nick it, he brings it up to my flat . . .Anyhow, cancelling Prime today as it - quite literally - is pointless, and then closing down my Amazon account, back to eBay for me, eBay deliveries are not perfect, but orders of magnitude better than Amazon's indifferent, lazy, disinterested approach.","August 16, 2022"

It's hard to get ahold of a real person through phone or chat anymore where that used to be the norm.The functions of their Subscribe & Save feature have really suffered from some of the improvements they've tried to make to it and when they say they had to cancel part of the order due to lack of stock or ""over pricing"" what they ACTUALLY mean is that they're not really cancelling it but are actually just going to send it to you and charge you for it at a later date. Without telling you. Which can lead to having WAY too much of some products on hand and too many charges on your card. Frustrating.But the cream of the crop is, by and far, their HORRENDOUS in-house delivery services! Almost everything that has come through them has arrived late, gotten lost INSIDE THEIR OWN WAREHOUSES, or I've had the delivery personnel straight up lie about leaving packages that haven't been delivered. Other people I know have had the same issues with their delivery services as well. I do not trust Amazon to get me my orders in the agreed upon time frames anymore and I'm starting to question why I have a Prime subscription when it doesn't seem to be doing me any good.Boo on you, Amazon.EDIT: After recent events, I'm dropping two stars down to one. Sounds like Amazon has been in the censorship business for a very long time (sorry to customers who've had their legitimate reviews deleted en masse!!) But now they're silencing millions of people.

Nothing posted that indicated where it had been left. And I never gave my permission to leave MY stuff with strangers. Previously, other delivery boys had just dropped my orders outside my door, on the pavement! Luckily, I noticed; otherwise, some passer-by could/would have picked it up for their own use. Amazon sucks! And their ""customer services""? ""Service""? Amazon needs to look up the word in the dictionary. Big Joke. They give you empty phrases, refuse to investigate, refer you to the police, they wash their hands, say they will not refund you, give you a deadline, until when you, the customer, have to comply with their orders.Whatever that bloke's name who owns amazon, he has fully joined the parasitic elites, as far as I can see.

Cardboard container has approx 2"" square hole punched thru bottom. Opened package to use jumbo bags to store freshly laundered comforter sets. Purchased electric vacuum pump to facilitate vacuum process as hand pump very difficult to use. Vacuum sealed four of eight bags; two of the bags re-inflated immediately. Bags did not hold a seal. Tried another 2 bags, neither held a seal. Tried the last two, both still sealed as of this writing.Called Amazon this date, explained circumstances, was told that 30 day window for return had past but that I could remove sealed contents of the four working bags and return them with defective bags for a partial refund. You do the math - Amazon expects me to pay for and return defective product at cost to me.For years I have purchased birthday, Christmas, Mother and Father's day, and Hannukah gifts and other items well in advance of holidays, expecting these items to be free of defect or that Amazon to replace or refund as part and parcel of good customer service.

Luckily I was at home working otherwise it may have been stolen. Amazon really need to instruct drivers not to act so irresponsibly by leaving packages outside in this way when there is an enclosed porch to leave packages. If they are still scared to touch the door handles to open the doors because of Covid, then perhaps they should not be delivering packages for a living because they are not doing their jobs as they should, this really is unacceptable and I am in disbelief that he did this. Judging by other reviews my experience is very common, I have been with Amazon since 2014 using prime, but if this is how their drivers are starting to behave then I will cancel prime & stop shopping on Amazon, gladly wait a few more days for delivery shopping elsewhere.","October 29, 2021"

The next screen said I was getting a 30 day free trial which I HAD ALREADY DECLINED.  There was no button to decline again.  I also got a similar box on the next screen meaning I had to phone Amazon to find out what was going on.  Why are Amazon like this?  When a customer declines an offer that should be enough.  I consider their practice deceptive and it's about time the authorities in this country put a stop.  Once Amazon prime has been declined it should never again appear on a subsequent screen during the placing of that particular order.  What a nasty, horrible company to deal with.  They are too big and too powerful and need cutting down to size.  I have also heard rumours that Amazon is withholding money from sellers.

I have tried to open a seller account as a business and private person, with the same result, a very bad experience.The first time a sales agent from Amazon contacted me and convinced me that my company should be present on Amazon. After some pressure from her side I accepted reluctantly. I filled out the sign up form and uploaded ALL the required documents. The amazon came back and asked for documents which where not required initially.  i sent them and they came back for more. The worst part is they actually charged my account for subscription before even validating and activating the account. I had to complain and have the account closed.A couple of year later I tried to open a private seller account, Once again I filled out the signup form, uploaded all the required documents. 1 month later and still nothing had happened. I contacted customer service by chat, and I was told the case would be escalated. 14 days later still nothing. I decided to use their online form to contact Amazon. A couple of days later I received an email, where they requested more information,  however the information requested was already supplied in my answers at signup when I filled out the form. Why waste my time by asking the same questions twice, specially after having me wait for over a month. Once again I notice my account was charged for a subscription fee, but how can this be possible, if my subscription is not active, the account not approved yet and I cannot sell on Amazon. Once again I had to contact customer service, I got a refund and I asked them close the account.It is easier to get a loan in the bank than it is to open a seller account on Amazon.

The most frustrating thing was my orders showed if the item didn’t arrived by “__”date, then I should return and I would be refunded. When I did this, they asked me to wait longer. After reattempting this 3 times over the course of 6 days, each time they did the same thing. Finally, I was refunded. 2 other items I’ve chatted about and the reps have told me on separate occasions that I don’t need to return the item and I would be refunded. I then donated the items because they were what I needed, and a week later, I have no refunds. I chatted with their CS and they said I needed to return the items in order to be refunded. I told the reps that I didn’t have them anymore because I donated them since the last reps told me I didn’t need to return the items. You can guess how this ended… no refund.

And I want to make you aware of this just in case it has happened to you. I noticed an unauthorised payment going out of my bank account to Amazon.com, now I have been a prime member with Amazon.Co.uk since 2011 and I have spent a lot of money with them. Now I contacted Amazon.Co.uk customer service regarding this unauthorised payment, they told me because the account was set up with Amazon.com. That it was Amazon.com that I had to contact, which I did so I explained to them the details of the payment. And I also told that this payment dated back to July 2018, so everyone please check your bank accounts and make sure that they haven’t set up a bogus account whereby you are paying them a monthly subscription by either paying it to Amazon.com or Amazon.Co.uk. Now as I have mentioned I have been paying for something that I have never used, and the payment has amounted up to £700+, the account was set up via a visa payment. Now I will give them a little bit of credit, because after contacting them they have paid me back 22 months. But I have be paying for the subscription for a total of 81 months, but if they can pay me back for some of the money. Why can’t they pay me back the full amount, now during the passed few years I have been of ill health due to becoming disabled and been on a lot of medication which has had an impact on my mental health and I am more or less sure that if I would of had my facilities I would of picked up on this pay sooner rather than later. All this has been explained to them, but they are telling me that there system will only allow them to go back so far. And that there system won’t allow them to be able to generate a payment no further than the 22 months.

If they had decided to reimburse me the full amount, I will be perfectly honest with you.

A third party where a family member resides in Florida about 2 months ago as a favor purchased 2 items I had asked my son to purchase for me. I sent the Photographs so he would know what items they were. I didn’t have knowledge that they would both be purchased at Amazon. They were a Tough Light 400 and an Eton Emergency Radio. I only know that my son indicated that the lamp was double the price advertised, no issue with the price of the Eton Radio. The items were carefully packaged with Bubble wrap and foam and mailed to me in Puerto Rico. Upon arrival, the Tough Light 400 although it looked perfect never turned on. I followed the advice of the manufacturer and nothing worked. The radio was operating well, however I noticed that there were scuff marks on one side and the screw where the Lithium battery was looked like it had been tampered with. I called Amazon first since I didn’t have a receipt or the address where the products were shipped to. Amazon immediately responded that I had to have proof of purchase to return and that after 30 days I needed to take the issue to the manufacture. Tough Light never responded to a message I left them and after sending an email expressing the diverse issues, there position was that in order to return and replace I needed to have proof of purchase. I know that every product sold has a unique number and ToughLight could have easily verified if the product I have was sold through Amazon m. That ended the story! However, the Eton Radio was not charging properly solar or with furnished plug to charge in an electrical outlet. The response was 180 degrees from Amazon and ToughLight! I explained the predicament I was in; not having proof of purchase and not acquainted with the person who purchased the products. People are reluctant to furnish credit card information to a person they don’t know, but I am very grateful for the gesture regardless. Eton, simply requested my address and committed to sending a shipping label. After they receive the Radio, they will send a new product. Therefore, my first experience with Amazon and last… I don’t have an exact date, however I do know the products were purchased and sent to me about a few weeks afterwards. By the time I got around to opening the package, my guesstimate is that 1 and 1/2 to 2 months time period from this date. ","July 16, 2024"

This is clearly a commercial decision, because Visa must be increasing the charges they take from Retailers. All Companies have the right to make commercial decisions especially as they have a responsibility to their shareholders, But is this right if it affects potentially millions of customers worldwide of a certain age. I am no lawyer, but does this not have a hint of age discrimination about it. Lets look at an example . Take Mr Adam Johnson (Not real name). Mr Johnson has been a loyal customer of  Amazon for years. He is aged 83, but now faces a dilemma. His Bank is Barclays Bank, who only offer Visa Credit Cards. Because of his age, he cannot obtain a Mastercard anywhere  although affordability is not an issue for him. He is retired and bags of disposable income. Amazons answer to the solution? Well its adios Mr Johnson and potentially millions of people worldwide whom are in the same situation as him. They have refused him an Amazon Mastercard, despite years of him paying Amazon invoices as they fall due. Amazon is the worlds richest Company, Do they really wish to alienate an ageing population in this way?

I've paid non stop for prime for over 3 years and I place a lot of orders on amazon. So I'd expect a decent level of support, instead what I get is rude customer service rep not addressing my issue, telling me they cant help and then hanging up on me. This being in regards to me ordering an item, amazon sending out the wrong model of item. As a result I start a return case, specifically let them know they've sent out the wrong item. They come collect the item and I wait over a week look at their return status page to see they haven't received it. I get fed up of waiting and contact the support team who tells me they've got the item but its the wrong model. I explain that this was why I made the return and that I mentioned this in the return notes. She says she cant help send an email address to get in contact with and asks if there's anything else she can help me with. Before I can even answer she ends the chat. So I start a new chat session, and believe me I have never come across support as awful and rude as I received in that chat session. A person by the name of Anish, tells me that that the issue has already been addressed, I let him know that the last customer service rep ended the chat and as a result I didn't get a chance to get a copy of the email address. Instead of resending the email address, Anish decides to tell me that an email has been sent to my Amazon in regards to this which I can reply to. Fair enough, I go to check my inbox, no email. I check spam, no email. I let Anish know that I have received no email and to resend. He tells me that the email has already been sent and to check again. I tell him no email has been sent.

I rarely write reviews even about the negative experiences but this is on another level of unprofessional.

I've shopped on Amazon for years, have easily spent thousands of dollars with them or more on Prime every month and on items I order but now i've been seeing on A LOT of items i've looked at a message saying ""if you have $25 worth of Amazon products in your order you'll get your items within two days"" but if you don't have $25 worth of Amazon products in your order they'll literally ship your items in the slowest way possible (Example: I was going to order a lot of Japanese candy- with the $25 order I would've gotten it in two days tops but without it I won't be getting it until the literal end of this month or into early next month) basically this is the same exact message users who DON'T have Prime get... so let me get this straight tho Amazon- me and countless other people GIVE YOU MONEY EVERY MONTH for Prime so we can get quicker 1 or 2 day shipping on our orders and instead of honoring that you're now making us pay $25 minimum on some orders to get our items shipped quicker (even though we're already paying you for that service)? I can't speak for anyone else but that's insanely insulting to me 😒 Instead of treating us like the loyal customers we are and giving us WHAT WE PAY FOR they're treating us like we're some random Amazon first timer who doesn't have Prime... So if you're a Prime member and see an item that has this message order the item you want from somewhere else 😒If this becomes more commonplace I won't be paying for Prime anymore because what's even the point if they're just gonna try to charge me for quicker shipping when I pay to get quicker shipping 🤦🏻‍♀️","June 22, 2021"

Back in August I had to speak with a supervisor to get the charges removed.  So the past two months I decided it's not worth the hassel.  They have lost packages and I never got them delivered to my home and when I asked the rep what happened the rep did not care and said it was lost.  Amazon advertises that they replace your items and they do not honor that all they do is give you a gift card that isn't even close to the value of what you order.  So I have decided that I might as well cancel my membership and account and my music and my kindle because it's not worth the hassell of the $14.06 and the money for reps who don't care.  Also even after I answered every security question that the supervisor asked me correctly and asked questions about my account she told me she couldn't give me any further information on my own account and why not it is my account and I just answered every security question correctly.  So my advises to anyone else be aware of Amazon.com.  I am strating to wonder if an employee is stealing form me and that is fraud and not okay.  Also she told me she would investigate the matter in regards to my account and obviously she did not.  So she does not care ither.  If she did I would not have seen charges of $14.06 on my account last month and today.,"October 08, 2020"

Review my order, 114-6839208-2656232 and look at all the issues from the moment it was ordered to Amazon dropping a chat, Sudha (sp?) giving me false answers and putting me on chat hold for over 18 minutes while she spoke with her manager (I finally disconnected) as she would not answer if she was still online or took her lunch, to your customer service scheduling a call to find my refund and not calling.  It has been an incredibly horrible experience!  My worst day on your ""e"" competitor was better than this.  My one repeated request was for a member of management to write, call, contact me so they are aware of ongoing problems I am having and even (you can read the chat's) would not allow me to contact management.

This overview of what has occurred since then will outline my complete lack of trust in Amazon and their customer service representatives along with my overwhelming sense of displeasure and unsatisfaction. On September 29, 2021 I noticed that there was unusual activity on my Amazon account. I saw orders that I did not place.  Once I realized that these orders were not placed by an authorized individual, I immediately called Amazon Customer Service to discuss options. I spoke to Rain on September 28, 2021. She was able to cancel a few of the other orders but some orders did get processed, such as the order number reference above. Prior to these orders placed, I had approximately $203 in unused Amazon gift card. The balance was kept active and I was looking forward to spending that money on upcoming Christmas gifts. After Rain was able to cancel some orders, I was told that $94.67 was back in the gift card balance that was I able to spend. The approximate value of $108 was being investigated. I was happy that Rain was heading this investigation.On September 30, 2021, I received the following email from Amazon indicating that my account was closed. I will include all emails notices that I received for your reference.  My understanding that this was normal protocol for something like this and while my case was being investigated and researched, I was more than happy to wait patiently until my account was opened and my gift card balance was restored. Unfortunately, the next few occurrences and contacts with Amazon have been completely unhelpful.  I received the following email from Amazon on October 1, 2021.  After receiving I called Jarlin, your Customer Service Rep on October 1, 2021. The nature of the call was just to get an update and ensure that my case was still moving along. I was told by Jarlin that this was part of the investigation and to have patience. I was happy to wait as long as this was being investigated. On October 7, 2021 I called as I did not hear from anyone at Amazon. Brian, your Customer Service Rep informed me that my account was now “On hold” which I understood this to be very different from an account being closed. Over the course of the next few weeks, I’ll just high level my experience and the outcome:-	October 11, 2021: spoke to Margaritao	She informed me that my account is being investigated by the Amazon Account Change Team-	October 15, 2021: spoke to Jimmyo	He informed me that my account now is being investigated by the Amazon Account Specialist Team – I’m assuming different than the account change team-	October 18, 2021: spoke to Juliano	He informed me that this is still being researched-	October 19, 2021: spoke to Leonardo and asked to speak to a Supervisor for escalationo	He passed me to Devin a Supervisoro	Devin, again, indicated that the Amazona Account Specialist Team was still investigating-	October 20, 2021: spoke to Isaaco	He informed me that the account is pending active-	October 21, 2021: spoke to Ashiao	I requested a supervisor again for a correct status report on my accounto	I was passed to Tiffany, who provided wrong information -	October 21, 2021: after Tiffany said I should call back and speak to someone else, I called backo	Spoke to Daryl who passed me to June, a Supervisoro	June again stated that the Amazon Account Specialist Team is still investigatingLastly, I’ll state the following. A trillion dollar company such as Amazon should have a more robust customer service experience. This entire experience has left me frustrated with Amazon.Further, it is not my intention to send this email viral however, I do need an acceptable response for me not to share my experience with others. I want to avoid that. Please resolve my account and restore my gift card balance. Kind Regards,BrendanI’ll close by sharing the emails that I received from Amazon on this matter:","October 25, 2021"

I have since been onto Amazon Germany who’s fraud department are looking into it and TSB are doing a international fraud check. I have asked for the call log twice for the phone call made to the uk branch as all calls are recorded to be put on hold for 10 minutes then rudely hung up on. I also tried to report this and was told they did receive a phone from my number or call me even though I used the call back service on there website with proof of the call. I have emailed there head office I reply I have tried to contact them again and will take no responsibility on the matter. My card is now blocked from TSB and still no money back,"February 14, 2021"

I called them filed a complaint about it. They investigated and returned with an e-mail that says ""you are right delivery guy did this on his own"". -I asked for replacement. They said there aren't any in stock. -I asked them to send the one which I couldn't even see. After all it was only carried by the delivery guy and its brand new. They said its not possible. Since it labeled as returned amazon sees that as used so they can't do that either.-Then I asked the refund which they already started without even asking me.-6 days past. no refund. I called them again. And the answer is I might have to wait up to a month on the top of this almost a month of waste of time. Because they need to investigate since the amount is bigger then 500 euro.So to summarise it: I have waited for almost a month for them to decide not to deliver.

Over the next couple of days I noticed a $6.99 fee come out of my bank account for Amazon prime membership. I did not sign up for prime. When I consulted with the help team they could not find the payment on their end. After they told me they would ring me back and did not I followed it up again. They said they still could not find the payment and I would have to dispute it with my bank. Thanks for coming we can no longer help you.So I have to waste my time and effort to go to my bank and dispute a payment which they clearly took out and are saying they didnt. Lets say Amazon has 1 million account holders and does this ""accidentally"" to every account holder, there's $7million and then they make it that hard to get it back most people would not bother.

I went to The UPS store with a email showing the return slip. When I clicked on the instructions it said sorry we cannot do this contact Amazon, when I was at the front desk. So I went home and was on a call with them for 50 minutes. Both items together we're about $37. The first person I talked to couldn't even figure out the problem. But when I talked to them they sent me another link and they said this will work. The first lady that I talked to kept on apologizing and said I'm sorry for the inconvenience, she wasn't sorry for the inconvenience. I wanted help and I couldn't get it. I was frustrated. I went to The UPS store to return the products and they said I needed a box for each item. So I had to leave The UPS store to go get boxes. I came back and when I was checking out they said I needed to pay a dollar for tape for each box. I was furious about the situation so I got charged $2 for tape. I was on the phone call for 15 minutes and I talked with two people and they tried to give me the runaround and say they understand that I'm frustrated but they really didn't. I think I could do their job better with understanding and realizing that they screwed up. I wasn't issued a refund I wasn't an issued anything saying they were sorry for the inconvenience and it's probably not going to be looked at. This was the worst customer service I have ever experienced. And I worked customer service at a grocery store for 10 years... This is the last time I deal with Amazon ever again.

As large as Amazon cannot deliver one basic item. This item has cost me over £1500 and like for the fact that they couldn’t deliver on two separate occasions and Me persistently doing chase calls to get it. Redelivered is absolutely outrageous if Amazon wish to advertise and put items on their webpage to do it, they intend to sell, and if they know that that item is going to be of some conceptive heavy and they need to facilitate that it shouldn’t be down to the customer to get through to the point whether they’re gonna get cancelled and then get a refund absolutely disgusting. I think Amazon need a seriously look at the logistic all operation because it doesn’t function doesn’t work on top of which I don’t think really at the end of the day that are doing the deliveries need to pay attention to the information that’s been sent. I sent information directly onto the Amazon website given specific instructions and they were not followed very basic. We had to do was open the back garden door.

I heard a vehicle coming down our lane.  I glanced out to see who it was, and saw an Amazon van rounding our circle drive to stop out front of our house, at our front door.   I finished what I was doing at hand, and walked out of the garage, and around front to meet the the driver to get my package. However, before I could get around front, the driver was already back in the van and starting to pull away. Instead of backing out of our circle, because of the car that we had parked there, the Amazon driver simply cuts through our yard to get around the parked car.  I was completely flabbergasted that the driver would do such a thing, especially right in front of a homeowner.  Due to recent rain, our yard was soft, and the van left large ruts in our yard where it drove through.  I tried to pull my cellphone from my pocket quick enough to get a picture of the Amazon van actually in the grass, but by the time I was able to bring my phone up and snap a picture, the van had gotten just beyond our grass and back in the driveway. Nevertheless, you can clearly see the damage, the trail of mud and water in the foreground and the Amazon van in the background, just beyond it.  Had I been a little younger, and faster on my feet, I would have chased the van to the end of the driveway where it stopped for a second, and confronted the driver.   Instead I chose to immediately call Amazon customer service and file a complaint. I sent the pictures, and my eyewitness testimony of the incident to the rep. Nevertheless, the old saying that the customer is always right, does not hold true with Amazon. They basically called me a liar, and said the driver denies driving through our yard, and added that the photos and my eyewitness testimony are not enough evidence, and dropped the claim.  If a representative from Amazon were to come out and look where the van is in the picture, where the damage was done, and note how the driveway is laid out, it's clear that he he or she had to have gone through our yard to either turn around, or otherwise go through our yard to get around the parked car and back on that part of our driveway, but Amazon wanted nothing to do with a little legwork on their part.  We had a birthday party scheduled for the following day, and I did not want guests to see the ruts in our yard, so I immediately started repairing them myself, as I was afraid if someone else saw tracks through our yard, they too would think it was OK - and the damage would become far worse. All I really expected from Amazon, to make me feel vindicated and satisfied, was an apology, and maybe a small credit for a future purchase ($50), for my time having to fix my own yard. But the Amazon representative didn't even ask what they could do to make it right. Instead, they shrugged off a loyal customer as a liar and closed the case. My response to Amazon was that I build homes for a living, making a very good, and well above average income, and the pennies I would get from them for fixing my own yard after their van drove through it would be tiny drops in a very big bucket of water. The point of my complaint was for them to acknowledge what had happened, make sure they communicate with their drivers about the importance of staying out of people's yards, and a very small form of compensation for my trouble. The compensation is of no value to me, but merely viewed by me as a method to set an example for them and their disrespectful drivers. Instead, they chose to side with their lying driver. This decision does little harm to me, as there is literally nothing Amazon sells that I can't buy elsewhere. With that, and additionally in my response to Amazon, I told them that I would never buy anything from Amazon again, and that I was banning Amazon vehicles and employees from our property. If someone else orders something to be delivered to our house through them, or if Amazon is contracted by another company to deliver, and I catch them on my property, I will call the police and file trespassing charges. This includes using our driveway- or yard as any form of turnaround. I will also be setting up static cameras to monitor my driveway and property. All of our friends and family will be made aware of this situation, and advised not to ship anything to our address from Amazon. Amazon would rather lose a loyal customer permanently, than acknowledge that their driver did something wrong, and take responsibility for that action. To me, that speaks volumes of the character of Amazon as a business. I would give Amazon ZERO stars if I could, but my justification is knowing that I can close my account, and take my business -and my money- elsewhere.F.O.

If I was Jeff Bezos, I would sack all of the corrupt drivers and other workers and make it imperative to make the service better. If the customer isn't home, try later instead of winging it, and lying about the delivery. Plus you pay for prime, and you get adverts, you get Alexa not understanding your voice on devices.

I looked out side and there was nothing.  I called customer service right away and instead of perhaps looking into it or contacting the carrier (since he likely would still be in the area) they just told me to wait until 4 P.M. Monday and call them back so they can either refund me or ship my order again.  No talk of refunding me the shipping charge at least.  Unbelievable that they would rather eat the cost of replacement so quickly and inconveniencing the customer rather than fixing the problem straight away and contacting the carrier.

She has been very rude towards me from the begging of the call when i asked her why is she rude she never answered when i asked her to connect to the superior she gave a reply which was not easy to belive she said no superior available and she cannot connect my call again when i asked why is she so rude she simply said as the customer is not having any further concerns iam going to disconnect the call this is what she said thrice and straight away she disconnected my call. if you guys are delivering good products no one has free time to request for return or refund i have been wasting my time trying to contact customer service placing return request asking for refund which did nt happen untill now. Upon asking to share the complaint number the customer service people keep on saying they have emailed me which i never received upon asking they said they are not authorized to share again and again iam sure there was no complaint raised i never received any call from the team lead which they mentioned they will organize. if you need more proof i have the call recording of the customer service person who was very very very rude also they are working from home not from office as all my previous customer service people when i contacted i can hear the back ground kids crying and sounds from kitchen and one customer service person was literally asking their family members to be silent as she was on a call i have experienced the worst customer service if i keep writing i dnt think a page will be sufficient i want to take to legal aswel ,"July 12, 2024"

Long story short this order's fate was exactly as the first one.Only plus to the above is that amazon didnt take the actual money from the card so there was no refund process in the way.3rd time i removed even more items and this time made sure that all of the items were items that were in stock and sellers the manufacturers. This time card was charged the full price.Well I'm still waiting the order to be sent 2 weeks later and delivery date was changed by itself from 2 working days to 1 month and this is with fast delivery option!!Sorry Amazon you became a failure, this is unacceptable.

I needed to apply a gift card balance to my Amazon account, but the online reply was that it was “invalid” though it has never been used.Since the online Customer service department suggested it would be best to “chat“ with a representative, I enter a summary of the problem I was having to make it easier for my customer service representative.After one hour of waiting for a representative to respond online, Aman Joined the chat and asked if there was anything he could do. Clearly he had not bothered to read my summary, so I copied all of the information and reposted it in my reply. After another 10 minutes, I asked Aman to escalate this conversation to his superiors as a complaint and ended the session that had wasted more than one hour of my time.I am sure that it comes as no surprised anyone but, Jeff Bezos and his Amazon crew seem to only care about taking easy money as there is absolutely no interest in providing any true “customer service.”","June 01, 2024"

After I finally get to a representative who can disable the 2FA from the old phone number it works for 2 weeks to 1 month and then the old phone number is re-enabled as 2FA on the account - completely without any action from my part.Amazon doesn't prioritize Account Recovery, otherwise there would be steps for customers to follow to disable 2FA indefinetily and regain access to the account.This is clearly not a priority however, they must assume everyone is creating new accounts - or simpy don't care.It is extremely illogical that current account login information is overwritten with old information (incl. 2FA phone number) but this is what happens.I can't access any of my digital purchases because amazon keeps locking me out of my account. This has never been an issue from my part. This is an amazon IT department technical issue relating to the account logins.I can't be the only person in the world this happens to, but I can only imagine that they are losing business cuz I have avoided amazon in every of my purchases if available elsewhere anytime, I'd even pay more to avoid amazon because this site is simply broken.What I think happens as a qualified software developer is that I think amazon has some legacy software between its site networks that might restore or synchronize an old backup incl. 2FA between accounts.There is no other logical explanation.But what is logical and completely reasonable to understand is that I will avoid amazon at all costs for all purchases.Horrible company, horrible services, horrible customer support.

Without warning, I was banned from leaving product reviews on Amazon. They accused me of receiving FREE goods and being paid to write reviews. WHAT??? No one has ever  paid me! nor given me free goods. (I WISH!!)I actually believe they blocked me for leaving a negative review for a company that was scamming people (that happened to pay to be featured). I phoned them to review their decision, and they emailed me, (see below), saying I should email them which I did - and they sent me the same email again.  Then they said that I had possibly been hacked but refused to give me further details… (what?!!). Was I hacked? I said I found it unlikely that someone would hack my account solely to leave reviews. What is the evidence??SO, what I take from this is they only want POSITIVE REVIEWS for some companies, and if you leave a negative one for one of their sponsored companies, they will ban you.  No freedom of speech. Everything being censored. Buy, buy, buy, we don’t care about you, the customer…like what? I tried to resolve this and they totally refused to listen. Here is their response Amazon previously sent you an email explaining that we had detected unusual review and rating activity associated with this account, leading us to remove all of its reviews and ratings, and restricting it such that it is no longer able to contribute reviews, ratings, customer questions and answers, and other related Community content. This account can no longer contribute content for the following reasons:-- Elements of the account indicate a relationship with sellers, publishers, or other reviewers on the reviewed products.-- Reviews and ratings were posted in exchange for compensation, such as gift cards, product refunds, review swaps, or free or discounted products.-- The account requested free or discounted products in exchange for reviews and ratings.-- The account was created for the primary purpose of writing reviews and ratings that violates our policies.-- An unauthorized party may have accessed this account to write reviews and ratings.As a result of your inquiry regarding this action, we reviewed this case and our decision thoroughly and have come to the same conclusion. We will not restore this account's ability to contribute with Community content. We will not be answering further emails from you, nor discuss this matter further. Your account will not be reinstated.Like what?! Is this customer service?  They won’t tell me what THEY thing is wrong with the review…(if it was a review)…nor let me check and see if I was hacked and someone did use my account to make fake reviews. Also everything they say they have banned me for is WRONG! WHAT the….?  Like why not just ask me to delete the one review that they didn’t like? Why ban me?) I have always been 100% honest.  What is ‘unusual activity?’ I have never sworn, been dishonest, never been paid, never had free goods, am a ‘normal customer that buys and pays for everything and leaves an HONEST review.’","April 01, 2022"

Here's the email I just sent them for removing all my always truthful reviews. All I can think is they are part of this scam the specific vendor is runningYou removed all my reviews because I warned people about a vendor and I have a letter from postmaster general and the fraudulent label to prove they committed mail fraud and also to get vengeance for leaving a truthful review about a shoddy product charged me and sent me the same product a week after I returned it. I've never given anything but accurate honest reviews and if you're going to start silencing customers I'm filing a complaint with BBB and letting everyone on social media know. Postmaster showed me the labels they use are created on Photoshop and then customer has to pay $12.43 for shipping cause the seller didn't pay the postage. The postmaster contacted the authorities because what the vendor is doing is a FEDERAL OFFENSE. NOT TO MENTION, I never ordered a 2nd pair and they not only charged me for them but then I had to pay postage. Same thing happened with 1st order. I returned those and only. Got back something like $12 which didn't even cover the postage. You need to stop silencing customers who have valid warnings and only. Post truthful reviews. I will not take the horrible way you've been treating me, freezing my account and now removed every review i ever posted plus I'll never be allowed to post a review again. I'm filing a complaint with BBB because your reasoning is unfounded and If I need to I will file a lawsuit for discrimination. You have a vendor scamming customers and rather than protect them you elect to allow it continue. Another way Amazon is proving they hold all the power and Americans are at the conglomerates mercy Will post a picture of the label when I get it from my mother's car tomorrow which proves this vendor is running a scam and Amazon is allowing it","September 10, 2024"

Reminded me of Newegg, but for everything.Then Prime happened... then Prime REALLY happened.I never used Prime, I got everything in 2-3 days anyway. Sometimes freakishly fast. Why get it? After Prime being out for awhile I started to notice that it took me the recommended time to get my packages... 5-8 (business) days. So I started watching the tracking more carefully only to learn, they would WAIT to ship my item so I got it in the recommended time, instead of just shipping it out like they used to.I justified Prime to myself as a smart way to not only enjoy (a guaranteed) 2 day shipping feature, but it made sense if I replaced Netflix with it. Let me just tell you Amazon Prime Video is nothing compared to Netflix. The mobile app is horrid too. I actually had to do research to learn how to get it on my phone, and then it was just poor. I don't even use it, think i removed it actually because Amazon was using the Prime Video app as delivery service for notification adds and other crap I didn't want.Now what really drove me to write this review. About 2 weeks ago I order a product, its about 6pm at night, I realize in like 15 minutes, I don't need it, I found what I thought I lost. I cancel within 30 minutes of ordering, it confirms it on screen, tells me I will receive an email shortly when the system updates it. Next morning I check my mail, my item has been packaged and shipped... in like 16 hours my item was never canceled, put in a box, and shipped out? I had to pay to return it by the way.Friday I order some more stuff, all Prime items. I get something Sunday (I was like OK Amazon, I see you). Today I check the mail for the main item... not there. I look in my Amazon account to make sure the item was Prime... it is, but I won't get it until Thursday.Amazon built something awesome, now they are coat tailing that reputation. In my personal experience, they have become money hungry, want to be in everything and are getting worse at what made them great. They try to rope you in to Prime so bad, even take away what used to be a great, fast buying experience to do so, and they whole Prime product its self is just smoke.Definitely canceling my Prime, plus Amazon isn't even as competitive with their pricing as they once were, I can online shop and check eBay and beat Amazon more than half the time now a days anyway and eBay (and many others) won't charge me yearly to make sure my item get shipped that or the next day.","February 15, 2016"

It is with great regret and frustration that I find myself compelled to leave a 1-star review after a recent experience that has left me questioning Amazon’s commitment to customer service and fair play.I recently purchased a 10th generation 256 GB iPad (Order No. 113-7489110-7733059), but upon delivery, I was shocked to discover a metal plate instead of the iPad I had ordered. Acting promptly, I reported the incident to Amazon within 30 minutes of delivery, providing all necessary documentation, including a detailed police report (Report No. 01-23-094996). Despite initially assuring me that a refund was in process, Amazon later retracted this and, without any valid justification, suspended my account, tainting my reputation by labeling me as a 'serial offender'.The handling of my case was not only unjust but it also highlighted a severe lack of evidence on Amazon’s part to substantiate their claims. Despite my efforts to resolve the issue amicably, including providing photographic evidence and engaging in extensive communication, Amazon has remained uncooperative. The discrepancy in package weight and the condition of the packaging upon receipt were clear indicators of tampering, yet my concerns were dismissed.My intent behind this review is not only to express my dissatisfaction but also to alert others to the potential pitfalls of dealing with Amazon’s customer service. It’s disheartening to have one's integrity doubted and to be denied a basic consumer right — the right to receive the purchased product or a refund.As I continue to seek a resolution through the Delaware Department of Justice Consumer Protection Unit, I am left with a tarnished view of a company I once held in high esteem. I can only hope that this review serves as a call for Amazon to improve their support processes and to treat their customers with the respect and honesty they deserve.Buyer beware – your loyalty may not shield you from a similar ordeal.","October 04, 2023"

Absolutely disgusted at the treatment I have received. I ordered a fire tablet which conveniently broke after 2 years and 6 days use. It was 6 days out of warranty and I contacted customer service who refused a refund or repair but instead offered a discount of 40% on a new tablet. They sent me an email saying to go ahead and order a new tablet and that I would be refunded a 40% discount of the price of the tablet. I ordered the tablet the following day and was waiting on the refund. 6 months later and still no refund. I have been on live chat trying to sort the issue and passed around countless different associates who have all been zero help! I have sent countless emails with zero response. I finally got speaking to an actual human being on the phone tonight who was even less help. This associate is apparently the highest in her team for customer resolutions and basically said yes she can see the email and promise of discount that was made to me but unfortunately it was incorrect and they cannot fulfill it and process the refund!!! I asked if she was happy breaching this written contract that was made between me and the associate and she said yes. I also made her aware that I never would have ordered the new tablet without the promise of the discount. She couldn't have cared less. I now have to escalate my complaint again and explain this to another individual who will more than likely fob me off also. Really disappointed and disgusted especially since I'm a prime member and constantly shop there. Will be cancelling my prime membership today!!! Absolutely fuming!

When I tried to contact Amazon (which is extremely difficult as they don’t have a phone number). I eventually received a call from the Philippines customer service centre saying that they are looking into my complaint (they have been looking into it for months). After many months of waiting and still getting the monthly amount deducted out of my credit card amazon called me requesting that I cancel my credit card with the bank. I told them that this was not a suitable solution as I have a lot of direct debits coming out of my account. So at the moment I am still waiting for a resolution from Amazon.

On multiple occasions, we have had to wait to ask for a refund and then repurchase, only to find a higher price on the same item. The customer service is a joke, there is no real concern for the consumer. The live agents are simply reciting from a textbook, and offering a meager credit to use on a future order.

I purchased a product which turned out to be defective, and since then, I have been caught in a loop of miscommunications and delays while seeking a refund for the return shipping costs.I had to shell out $180 NZD to return this faulty product. According to Amazon's policies and the Amazon Renewed Guarantee, this cost should be fully refundable. Despite numerous attempts to resolve this, it feels like I'm wrestling with a gigantic corporation that seems bent on ignoring my legitimate concerns.If you're considering making a purchase from overseas on Amazon, I'd strongly advise against it. In the event the product is faulty, you might find yourself spending a significant amount of money to return it. Even worse, Amazon may employ a strategy that leaves you feeling disheartened: making you communicate with numerous unhelpful individuals, passing the buck between departments, and forcing you to repeat your situation over and over with no end in sight.This whole ordeal has been extremely unsettling and exhausting. The absence of professionalism, customer care, and straightforwardness has pushed me to escalate this issue to the New Zealand Commerce Commission.I'm sharing my story not only to seek a resolution for my situation but also to warn others about the potential difficulties they may encounter in a similar scenario. Customers deserve respect, honesty, and fairness, and I sincerely hope my experience can serve as a warning for others.","May 21, 2023"

The item’s value is over $300. Unresolved. Hours later at 11pm at night I get an Amazon rep who calls asking me to verify my identity. Um, you called me and I did not request a call, you verify your identity! 11pm at night, really? When Prime runs out I’m done. Non-stop issues with this company and bad customer service.

You have major gaps in your customer service and the way you handle fraudulent charges.  I was notified I had fraud on my account and my Amazon account was promptly shut down.  I could not verify or deny the charges since I am locked out of all aspects of my account.  Because I order a lot of items from Amazon I had no idea what was fraudulent and what was not.  It took me over 2 weeks and 9 phone calls to customer service, to just get a comprehensive list of ordered items that I could verify.  But alas, my account is still closed.I replied to every email, requesting the last 2 of a credit card, but news flash - my card was compromised.  I do not seem to have another active card associated with this account.  Therefore I cannot give the last 2 digits of my credit card, I have tried.  All I get is automated emails and no one to help me resolve the issue.Your customer service sent order numbers, without associated items, so all customers have to dig through emails to figure out what items they are.  Then there are other emails with no item stated that just request the last 2 of a credit card.  While I will happily pay for my charges, I am not just going to give my credit card without any item(s) specifications for Amazon to charge how they please.  Especially when there was supposedly fraud on my account!  I cannot seem to verify my identity with a new credit card and am caught in a endless loop of customer service agents who can't solve the issue and emails requesting credit card information (last 2 digits) that is not linked to my account.This is such terrible customer service to a loyal customer who has spent thousands of dollars at Amazon.  I have been hung up while being transferred, told totally different information by the same agents answering Amazon's phone, but each agent told me they can't do anything and to wait for an email.  My 2 Amazon Alexas are closed down, 3 Amazon kids tablets, and of course ordering.  I have now spent hours on the phone trying to resolve and pay for items I ordered.  It's totally and completely ridiculous and needless.  You need to take a close look at how you are treating ""valued"" customers, because it is beyond frustrating and deplorable.","July 13, 2020"

I didnt give 5*, I gave 4* because the strip lights fall off during the night. Nothing a little glue wont fix so I'm still happy. I'm not happy that Amazon once again doctors its review system.

One of their drivers, who delivers packages to post offices, begs each postal employee for money and cigarettes.  He either attempts to scam them, or just asks outright.  “Nicholas” does this at every stop on his route, and will even sit around in the parking lot, hitting them up as they show for work.  Even if he was just there a couple of days earlier, he repeats the scamming and begging, all over again.  He claims to be a supervisor, but I think it’s just more of his lies.  How low of a person do you have to be, to think it’s okay to scam federal employees, or anyone, for that matter?!  Since Amazon does not care about anyone who comes into contact with their workers, it is not very surprising that this type of bad behavior is allowed.  Their customer service needs major help, as well.  Recently, I phoned and was connected to Singapore.  Amazon workers hung up on me, lied to me, told me to call back, etc.  Due to all of these issues, I ended up having to speak with four different employees, that day.  Five days later, the bank notified me of a fraudulent charge of $700, made in Singapore.  Clearly, Amazon keeps allowing their employees to treat customers with zero respect.

The delivery company has the one of the worst ratings a company has on the internet and uses students to deliver items. When I wrote a review of my experience Amazon refused to post the review because they believe I should only comment on the features of the product. I will never receive the product so how can I comment on it!How dodgy are Amazon! You effectively have your money stolen, never receive the product and they won't allow the review to appear on the website because I can only comment on the features. How can I comment on the features if I never received the product!!!! There must be hundreds of thousands of people out there like me who have had their money stolen in situations like this or had huge delays with receiving the product. Amazingly they didn't even offer to help me!!!! Beware, you will regret buying through Amazon!!!!The full review I wanted posted on the Amazon site is as follows:My watch was delivered when I wasn't home and the courier left a card. That part was ok, but everything after that point has been terrible. The card has no phone number to contact the company and it is asking me to submit a form online. When I follow the instructions on the card it is impossible for me to submit the online form to Fastway. I then waste my time searching for a phone number and call the company. No one is there to pick so I am asked to leave my number and someone will get back to me. A week passes and no one gets back to me. My friends birthday has now passed and I don't have a gift and I will be lucky to ever receive the watch. The delivery company is called Fastway and if you read the reviews it is probably the worst company in the world. The experience, even if I one day receive my watch, has been a nightmare from beginning to end. I would have been better off paying more elsewhere.Three months after I made the purchase my position was as follows:  It has been about three months since I ordered the watch and I am no closer to receiving it, with no help being offered by the seller or Amazon and no way of contacting the courier. I have checked the update of my purchase and it has been marked as ""delivered"". The option Amazon provide me on their website is to pay to purchase another watch!Three months and a few days after I made my purchase my position was as follows:  I found out the courier marked the watch as delivered two weeks before they even attempted delivery. That means the courier held the watch for two weeks for even bothering to attempt delivery.Also, because I put a negative review on this site about Fastway, they returned my watch back overseas to the seller. I emailed Amazon a few days ago asking for their help and received no reply.Be warned - don't ever use Amazon! Some situations might work out well, but when it goes wrong there is no one to help you. It is simply not worth the risk to go through months of worry. Amazon should be shut down.Five months after my purchase and my position was as follows:I ended up ordering a watch from ebay. It arrived in days and I was able to post a review about the experience and include details related to the shipping.I had to ask my bank for a charge back on my credit card because Amazon refused to help me obtain a refund even though the watch was returned to the seller. When my bank contacted Amazon to discuss the charge back request Amazon sent me an email asking why I wanted my money back when I already had my watch. I replied and then Amazon refused to communicate back to my bank so I had to wait 45 days before my bank could then take my money back from Amazon.It sounds like Amazon provided customer service years ago but now it is the most dodgy company you will ever encounter. You are better off trying to buy something from a market stall in Bangkok over the internet as opposed to going through Amazon. I honestly don't know how they remain in business. It must be that they just churn through people one at a time until people become turned off. One day they will run out of inexperienced people to screw over and the company will fall over.","November 13, 2017"

They advised me too reorder a new tablet, and I would be refunded once it arrived of £150. This advice took place on online chat , and I have the messages to prove this claim. However, after hours on the phone they agreed a refund but only refunded me the amount I had originally payed for item.  To me this is complete dishonesty on Amazon’s part! And they conned me out of my money !!!!  2nd the item never arrived so I contacted Amazon, who sent me a replacement tablet out.  Well this is what I thought ! Instead they charged me another £150 without my permission. So for a replacement tablet I am £210 out of pocket. I have contacted Amazon numerous times, they either put the phone down after waiting endlessly to be passed over. They are just so unhelpful. I have opened a dispute with the bank now, as I am owed £210, and I have evidence to back up my claims  My  overall judgement is that these tablets don’t come with two year worry free warranty. I will never get the time back I have spent trying to resolve this. And Amazon owe me an apology. And not a fake one which I keep hearing. “Im sorry you feel like this “but no ACTION!","December 04, 2022"

They wont give a senior a discount even though they offer it on amazon.com. They customer service is HORRIBLE. Even having Prime just because you're promised same day or next day delivery you dont get it. It is a shame that Amazon can treat their customers and members with so much disrespect and nothing happens to them. Its pretty funny that according to Amazon my state of California requires them to charge us tax on our membership but I dont pay tax on my gym or Costco membership. So it appears that California only allows Amazon to charge us tax on our membership. WHAT A FRAUD!!!!!!,"October 27, 2019"

The review was declined by Amazon so I am posting it here:The product is probably great - I bought it as a present for someone. What really got me annoyed, though, is the Amazon process. The product was advertised on the web site at £24.99. When the pre-order acknowledgement came through it showed £25. Not a huge difference, I know, but, on principle, the price advertised should be the price charged. Had a web chat and was assured that the correct price would be charged when the product was despatched. When the product was despatched I was charged £25 and so had to get back in touch again. The customer service team offered me compensation but, in a sense, that’s not the point. I suspect (possibly incorrect) that this has arisen because of rounding on VAT. There are two principles here - firstly charge the customer what you promised and then pay over the correct amount of VAT (to be compliant). The net is your income. If Amazon can get away with this enough times then that’s a significant amount of money. It is fundamentally (on principle) wrong to overcharge your customer, however much that may be.","September 06, 2019"

Even though they had no proof that I ever did such a thing. Whatever. I didn’t care. Then later on, just a few months ago, I made a payment of over $200 which paid off my store card. A month ago they shutdown my card without any notice!! I chatted with them to ask why. They said it was due to a non payment???? I even had proof of payment!!! It showed on the Amazon store card app itself!!!!!!! And they say they can’t see it??? I took a screenshot of that $230 payment on THEIR app and then one of my bank showing it and then disputed it! Later they said they see the payment but wouldn’t turn my card back on. Ok again. Whatever! Then just yesterday I received another email stating that they did not find the payment and now I have to pay that AGAIN!!! I am beyond angry at this point! I live on a set budget. I can’t afford to throw away another $230!!! I had all the proof I needed to prove I paid it! And they want to say that it’s not enough???? Well guess what? Now I hate this store and refuse to do anymore business with them. And I am going to dispute this AGAIN! Idc how many times I have to fight it. The proof is all right there and they are just trying to rip me off.

Do your best to not buy anything from them any longer or if you can cancel your accounts. This company has no accountability as of 2020. 1. If your account gets hacked oh well. very little or no customer support. While the hacking is still happening they will not freeze the account immediately it will take them 24 hours to do anything.2. If you return items or an item there is a chance they will lose it and blame you. And then you will have to eat the cost.  They have lost 4 items this year returned and I am still not got my money back on two items. 3. Watch out a lot of primes are sometimes really NOT prime thus meaning that you will not get any guarantee of refund. They will sneakily remove the prime after a purchase.  4. Packages are never placed properly in the correct area your house could be in the middle of a busy street and they will throw your package on the sidewalk and called it delivered AND even take a picture of it misplaced in the wrong door or on the sidewalk, even after BOLD LETTER instructions requesting all packages place in the back. 5. Just because someone stole your package if it's under $100 bucks it's considered YOUR LOST! EVEN IF YOU FILED A POLICE REPORT. 6. Most customer service support is from the Philippines or India they all follow a script so don't expect any customer action to happen in a timely matter. This is just a deflection from the main customer support which is in the USA.  To get the American customer support you will have to escalate your issue. 7. You can not send any kind of complaint to any kind of complaint department, All completes goes to customer service, then-Supervisor. That's it. You cant file a formal complete you have to literally write a letter and send it to their PO box snail mail style. 8. 30% of your purchase comes used or repackaged without any notification or warning even when you specifically purchased it as new.  And when you return it and request a new item they will deny the customer and accuse you of their mistake. 9. Alexa is crap I own 4 Alexa dots and such still after 4 years this stupid device does not understand ""Turn off kitchen light""  or ""turn off tv"" by anyone. You can have Betty White tell Alexa to turn off bedroom light "" and instead it will turn on your toaster every freakin time.

They had so many delivery dates, even Christmas Day which I KNEW wouldn't happen.  Finally THEY sent my items back to the seller but told the seller I SENT THEM BACK.  They won't even own up to their driver not delivering packages.  I have a business and if/when I get the last of my deliveries I'm cancelling it and just using prime and cross my fingers.  They offer a refund, but they didn't fulfil their part of the contract (I order pay you deliver) so it's MY MONEY and OWED to me.  If I lied to my customers and sellers I would be out of business.  Evidently this is the new Amazon business plan.  LIE LIE LIE LIE","December 27, 2022"

In a really regressive step of you object to your treatment by the customer service team you can escalate your issue to.......guess who - the customer service team!I contacted Amazon regarding unauthorized Amazon Prime deductions from my credit card. They found 2 payments linked to another account but could not provide any details quoting data protection legislation. I asked them to stop the payments as the account was using my personal information to make unauthorized payments via my personal credit card. They refused to do this and said I should contact my credit card company. I have no issue with contacting my credit card company but I expect Amazon to protect me and my personal data when I'm using their site - especially when I'm alerting them to potentially fraudulent behaviour.I complained about this and they assured me they would look into the matter and contact me.......nothing since and that was over 5 weeks ago.

I decided to part company with Amazon when their customer service department contradicted itself, claiming that my account could not be restored when just the previous evening someone from the accounts department had been on the verge of doing precisely that, lacking only immediate access to my email for verification (unfortunately I was away from my computer at the time). I was told I now needed to set up a new account, but in doing so I now stand to lose several years of accumulated Kindle books. On account of this dire, confused and unhelpful customer service and the prevalence of scams and fakery I can only rate Amazon at 2 stars even though you can buy anything there and the app is easy to use. Many I am sure would have only given it one star.","September 03, 2024"

If you try to reach out again - they will apologize and say 'we will send the labels' and still NOTHING comes.

Last few times I tried, it's a struggle to get to checkout and find that if I select the Free Shipping option, it automatically signs me up for Prime membership, even though I did not select that option earlier in checkout. I know it's able to be cancelled. But everything selectable towards Checkout doesn't inform me that the Trial Membership WILL be added, just that my purchase will qualify if I exceed $35.  I've never had to deal with that in the past and now never know what might have changed from order to order and need to proceed with caution.  So my complaint to Amazon is why do you make simple things so complicated?  So I find myself shopping for the same items at Walmart.com.  Update: I went to Walmart.com after this review and found the item. Originally, I had several things in Amazon Cart to exceed $35.  The one item I originally was looking for was only only $7 on Walmart and still got a speedy FREE SHIPPING checkout process.  HAPPY AGAIN.And now as I look back at the shipping details, it seems now the $35 is $58 to qualify, but most all the things I was shopping for still tout $35 to qualify.

The customer service agent ignored my request and stated multiple times that they were going to reach out to the team to have the issue addressed.  It should have already been done from the first chats my son did, but I’m guessing it didn’t.After restating my request for a gift card the agent put me on hold and came back to offer a $5 promotional credit stating that is the max they were able to offer.   I declined and decided to post a review where others could see it!I have been an Amazon customer for years and rarely return items.  This isn’t the first time we’ve gotten the wrong strange object instead of what we ordered.

This is not the first time I have experienced such issues, and it is becoming increasingly frustrating.Key Issues:Missed Guaranteed Delivery: The 1 PM delivery guarantee was not met, causing significant inconvenience.Extended Delay: The delivery is now expected to be up to four days late, which is unacceptable.No Cancellation Option: There is no option to cancel the order until it is delivered, which is very off-putting.No Refund for Delivery Fees: Despite paying extra for the guaranteed 1 PM delivery, there is no option for a refund of these charges.Impact:These repeated delays and the lack of effective resolution options have severely impacted my trust in Amazon's service. The inability to cancel or receive a refund for the delivery fees adds to the frustration.Decision:Due to these ongoing issues, I have decided to cancel my Amazon subscription. The repeated failures in delivery and poor handling of these situations have led me to seek more reliable alternatives.Overall, this experience has been extremely disappointing, and I hope Amazon takes steps to improve its delivery services and customer support.But looking at all the previous reviews they never seem to read any of them so they will never learn how to improve.Sincerely,","July 30, 2024"

Recently I purchased a $50 gift certificate for a relative’s upcoming 90th birthday. The selection made included a cute pop up birthday card:box to house the certificate yet when the box was opened, the gift certificate card was missing. I contacted Amazon about this issue wand was told an investigation would be conducted and to watch for an email response within 24 to 48 hours. Unfortunately, there was no communication from Amazon so I initiated another phone call with the same info. Again, the same pseudo result occurred with no communication. After 6 phone calls and speaking to 2 supervisors I was told the “window for returning” the gift card was closed. Excuse me …. “What gift card? Oh, you mean the missing gift card which I have repeatedly been inquiring about and assured was under investigation?”Obviously, there will be no refund nor any explanation given for this problem. My next action will be to write to Amazon although I do not anticipate a response of any kind. When my Prime membership is due to renew in August 2024, I am finished with Amazon.

I have unknowingly purchased counterfeited items, experienced issues from them (as many other customers), and asked Amazon to consider removing the seller(s), but they didn't even respond. Furthermore, every single time a review contains anything even remotely negative related to Amazon, they block it (against community guidelines). For example, my last review, only mentioned that an item was low quality because easily broke during transport: they blocked it!! It's infuriating that they don't respect freedom of speech! Lastly, they increasingly don't show the negative reviews about products (likely to favor the selling of the merchandise). Anything to make more money, as if they did not have enough already, no matter what the harm to the customers may be. Unfortunately, they will continue to do what they do, and worse, because at the end we'll use Amazon again. These reviews are merely a way to blow out steam, and have the voice that Amazon routinely silences, but we are too used to the convenience of ordering something and receiving it the next day, so we are going to accept the bully....sad.

Every thing he does is just plain stupid. Maybe I am being harse but nobody will every read his book. No memember of his family has bothered to even take a peak inside. How do I know this, because Bob has posted it on Facebook. I looked him up out of curiosity. He has made many stupid videos, all complete nonsense. Why does he bother.

I'm in Denmark and have been buying goods from the German Amazon for about a decade now.I've just been given my latest refund, which was for an awful Logitech MX Keys keyboard which luckily had one of its keys fall off after about 18 months, meaning I was still under warranty. I hoped to then be able to sell the brand-new replacement for a decent amount and buy a better keyboard, but Amazon just offered a full refund, which I happily accepted.I've had returns on close to ten orders, some of which have been swiftly closed with ""refund issued, no need to return the item,"" the others returned with a prepaid parcel slip that just needs to be printed and stuck on the box, and once they've received the item back, a refund has been issued.Once I bought twelve bottles of baby oil (enough to get free shipping), and it was delivered damaged with three bottles having escaped through a hole. I called the local carrier and was put in queue as number 90-something. While waiting I checked the Amazon website and discovered the option to have Amazon call you up. I activated it and was immediately called on my phone by an employee who promptly refunded me money for the three missing bottles, no questions asked. The local carrier called me back two hours later.This last refund was set in motion by the friendliest German supporter who laughed with me at my broken German and did his best to follow my better English.If there's one negative, it's that the search function on their own website is basically useless, so I have to use Google with ""site:amazon.de"" added to the query instead.I see many negative reviews based on having been fooled by refund scammers, fake websites, or forgetting your password and blaming Amazon, hating on Bezos (which I agree with), or some other random own-fault issue.I've spent at least 10k € over a decade and NEVER had a bad experience with them.People, if someone randomly calls you up and say they're from Amazon (or any other business), hang up the phone and block that number.

First problem: there's no porch. Second problem and the reason for my complaint: THERE'S NO SIGN OF A DELIVERY OF ANY SORT ANYWHERE TO BE FOUND!!! And Amazon makes sure that I will never get it!!! They say to use their chat, only the chat isn't available!!! There were two failed deliveries priced at $8.20 and $11.28. Neither order arrived. I have given the most explicit instructions; maybe I have to draw a photo map as well?!?!?!? Now I worry that all the orders I place are going to be left just anywhere and I'll just pay for things that I'll never receive. I notice that direct interaction is not possible. That forces me to file complaints elsewhere, which is what I am doing now because I am given no alternative. And I don't appreciate lying of any sort. No, it was not delivered to my door. Funny that Walmart managed to deliver to me with no problem. Amazon has failed me. There's no other way to describe it. I feel sick now. This is what is done to a disabled senior male these days. I'll just post my complaint everywhere possible; I have no other alternative. Some possibility of making contact with a human being should be available; when no possibility is made available, ripping off a customer is child's play. If I have to go out and lead the delivery person by the hand to get to my door, TELL ME SO IN PLAIN ENGLISH, A LANGUAGE IN WHICH I HAVE WRITTEN AND PUBLISHED!!! Amazon has a publication of mine on record, so they can't say my instructions aren't clear. What burns me most is the lying. Delivery was not made. The app gives me no way to make contact. Maybe they assume I'll die before a delivery is made. I give up. I have no way of guessing anymore. If Walmart made a delivery to my door, Amazon should have been able to do the same thing -- maybe. Normally, they store large deliveries in lockers on the property here and give the customer codes to log into the lockers. Instead, they claimed to deliver them to my door when there was nothing to be found. I faxed them about this development and received no notice of change in my favor.","June 01, 2024"

The only part of the review Amazon could be referring to, is that we indicated that Amazon permits sellers to charge shipping fees for a product that Amazon warehouses ship for free - let me clarify that. If the seller has product in stock, ""they"" ship it and charge a delivery fee. If they do not have it in stock, but Amazon has it in their warehouse, Amazon ships it directly, with no delivery fee added. Yeah, that sounds totally backwards, but that was the information we received from Amazon Customer Service. We stated in our review that this is not a ""customer first"" approach, because Amazon does not clearly notify the buyer about this practice. I guess Amazon does not like ""truths"" being posted within reviews on their own website. Amazon used to be the best ""big business"" company for customer service, but they have slowly and steadily become a ""money first"" entity. Need more proof?

There used a place where you could request Amazon packaging instead of Original boxing. How do I stipulate “AMAZON PACKAGING ONLY” for all my items? What happened to “Live Chat” ?

Don't get me wrong they have loads of brands, variety, and prices many times are better than the seller's own website's but all good things on the surface have hidden costs. More than half the time delivery days change often without any explanations. Once I received a completely different product than I ordered and couldn't get the proper product from that seller so had to go through similar items to find a more pricey deal anyways. They did gift card the price but many times I've received items that barely resemble the ad and certainly weren't the quality the reviews said so it makes you wonder how do they stay on top? IMO humans are lazy, we don't want to have to go to five stores to get five types of things combined with free shipping that only seems free. I would also guess Amazon knows what other mega stores online or not do:you don't need the best quality if you have enough items just a bit cheaper than the competition and become a one stop shop. Ultimately my choice to go with Amazon for products, or not, isn't likely to change their business model as look at their profits year over year. But that's just one opinion among hundreds of millions and I've experienced some sellers that have quality products and they probably want a piece of the $$$ that comes with being connected to the fifth largest company worldwide, I can understand that.

My bank has confirmed that the bank details I gave Amazon are totally correct and I confirmed that the transaction with Amazon  was approved, but still the saga goes on. It's not a serious issue as can use the Echo Dot without the subscription, but I do get stressed with the adverts that keep interrupting the music. They suggested an alternative method of payment, but there is no alternative unless I post £5.99 in cash every month.

When the ""new"" speakers arrived, one of the main tower speakers and the set of two Atmos ceiling-directed speakers were obvious returns. The tower speaker was without the soft foam ""sock"" that keeps it from being scratched and the Atmos speakers were carelessly wrapped in the soft foam (hanging half off) plus there were the remains of speaker wires being previously attached. I sent the tower speaker back to get another one and Amazon would only do a credit to the account and not a refund. I kept the Atmos speakers as they seem to work ok, but I felt cheated. These items should have been sold as ""warehouse"" items at a reduced price. New is new and not kind-of new and we pay a premium price for that privilege. The most recent problem was with a lightening arrester that I needed. I bought an item that would work with standard coax used by satellite and cable companies but received an item that was for larger coax. I sent it back for another one only to get the same wrong item. I'm now dealing directly with the producer of the item who is correcting the situation.After having the problem myself, I have since read where others have experienced the same problems. To add to the problem, Amazon has made it impossible to find and actual contact phone number where you can talk to a human to right things. If not for being able (at this point) to Google the number, I could not have talked to someone.These are some of the signs of a non customer-centric company.","April 12, 2024"

Also, they will make you wait days after the delay before you can cancel and get your refund. Don’t even bother to call customer service they can care less. We will be pulling about half of our orders a year from them. The only thing that is reliable is their grocery service fresh.","April 09, 2024"

Now that would be a minor miracle - given the owner lives in Geneva!SOMETIMES a pic's taken - so it's obvious it's not been delivered to our property!My beef is that Amazon doesn't give consumers a 'feedback button' to say item NOT delivered as claimed by driver.I guess it doesn't want the hassle of addressing the issue - and isn't interested in consumers' frustration at the problem!

That can then lead the couriers to be super aggressive when delivering parcels. For example, a courier knocked on our door so aggressively to the extent that any person with heart problems could have been in very deep water! So, Amazon, if you are reading this, please start giving your couriers better working conditions and more respect as human beings. Doing so will likely improve their wellbeing as well as the customer experience due to a reduction in aggressive behaviour when delivering parcels.","April 08, 2024"

What I don't like is that when you buy something online it goes straight from clicking ""Buy"" to ""It is on its way"".  This makes me nervous.  It doesn't go to the page where you have to verify your card details and insert the security code, which other sites have.  This means that either Amazon have found a way of getting around the security code, or else they have recorded it on a previous transaction.  This seems very wrong.  It feels like it would be too easy to buy something by accident when you had only gone there to window-shop.  This makes me want to be cautious and Amazon seem aggressive.  I wish this would stop.","March 18, 2024"

When I started using Amazon about a year ago my main concern was if I could return items if they didn't work out. I tore up my knee and can't get out to do my purchases and Prime seemed to be a good option aat that time. I could use Prime video and returns were easy. I could take my return to the UPS store half a blck away and they would print my label, scan the item and done!  Recently everything has changed for the worse. They no longer use the same courier company and all the options for drop off are too far for me due to the mobility issues. The free pick up option looks good until you spend the entire day waiting for the pick-up only to get notified at 9pm that you have been rescheduled for the next day. This goes on for days sometimes. I'm sorry, you wanted to shower or take your dog out to pee? Too bad. Most recently I recieved the okay from customer service to leave my pick up at the door and when I got out of the shower they had only picked up one of the two items that were in the same box. By the way, contacting customer service is almost impossible. Good luck finding the link to request a call or actually talking to a person. The AI call doesn't give you the option to talk to a person, you have to know to say ""talk to a person"". The chat doesn't actually chat, it is just more self help. They don't want to know what their customers think.Then there is Prime Video. All the shows I was watching suddenly came with a price tag. The garbage that was left has comercials and isn't worth watching. I haven't watched anything on Prime for weeks. I bought one movie that I will say goodbye to if I cancel but it may be worth it.As for the products, hit or miss as usual. If I am familiar with a brand and it works for me it is usually a safe bet. Otherwise it definitely is a gamble.","March 25, 2024"

Little did I know that this journey would be filled with both laughter and bewilderment.As a buyer, my experience has been mostly positive. Amazon's vast selection of products and speedy delivery make it a convenient choice for all your shopping needs. However, there have been times when I've encountered the occasional weirdness with returns. It's like trying to find a needle in a haystack while blindfolded and hopping on one foot.But fear not, dear reader, for I have discovered a hidden treasure! On rare occasions, I've managed to summon a human customer service representative. These elusive creatures are surprisingly pleasant and possess the power to make your problems disappear with a wave of their magical wand.Now, let's talk about the dark side of Amazon: the seller experience. As a small business owner, I must warn you that Amazon is a greedy and ridiculous platform. It's like a dragon hoarding all the gold and leaving you with just a few measly coins. Their policies are designed to maximize their own profits, leaving sellers feeling like they're on a never-ending quest for fairness.To all aspiring merchants out there, I would advise you to tread carefully in the treacherous realm of Amazon. Offer your products on their platform to reach a wider audience, but don't put all your eggs in this basket. Instead, create your own enchanted website and offer your wares at a slightly lower price. It's like offering a secret discount to those who dare to venture beyond the Amazon kingdom.In conclusion, dear reader, Amazon.com is a land of contrasts. As a consumer, you'll likely have a good experience, but as a seller, be prepared for a wild and unpredictable journey. So, gather your courage, sharpen your wit, and may the odds be ever in your favor!","March 23, 2024"

I am so disgusted with these people I could scream!I will summarize to the best of my ability. They are playing games with the way they bill things out and being denied. When they originally debit my card for the total...that amount is set aside for them for up to 10 days. Then they have to finalize when they ship. They are changing the information or something when they finalize resulting in a denial. So I was forced to put money onto my gift card balance and shop that way. Which by the way is taken from my debit card IMMEDIATELY WITH NO PROBLEMS. So I purchased 2 pair of leather boots for work but returned them both. I started looking elsewhere for boots until Amazon informed me that I would NOT be getting my money back!! They put it back on the gift card but will not give me a refund to my debit card. Which now means that I have to save up that money AGAIN to buy boots somewhere else.Being that they were attempting to bill the WRONG DEBIT CARD they were also denied and since have suspended my account. After being on the telephone for at least 3 hours and 4 representatives I have been informed that they are going to KEEP MY MONEY! They told me that they cannot reinstate my account... that I have to sign up all over again. But they WILL NOT transfer my credit balance to the new account and they will not refund it to my debit card! EVERY BIT of this is THEIR FAULT. I don't know what kind of SHADY AF accounting practices they have but it is what has caused ALL of this chaos. And as a result I have to be the one to pay for it.

I dont use their software services much as I already had spotify/ youtube but have still got value from prime delivery through their food and items as well as occasional prime video and audible. There's more they can be doing environmentally to offset such a large footprint but due to how logistically efficient they are it brings down the CO2 emissions per parcel compared to driving to collect the same item yourself! They can also invest in electric or alterenative fuel methods for their vehicles.Paper and cardboard packaging on all orders is recyclable/reusable and I've been able to support small online/sustainable businesses through the marketplace The shopping experience is excellent and the delivery very professional.The value offered is great, and with such a large selection of products and reviews its not difficult to find what you're after. The tracking and history of orders is exceptional, as well as the ability to create multiple lists (wish lists) that could be shared.Used items can also be found on the platform too, which is a better choice for the environment than brand new, I've recently found a growing offering of recycled plastic items which is even better as it creates a demand to get the products out of our environment.I barely touched on the software/ streaming applications and services offered which is a large part of the subscription and could be worth the monthly fee in it's own right.I'd be quite surprised if you had anything but a positive experience. I can't comment from an empoyee/ seller side of the company but as a customer I keep coming back and will continue to aslong as I receive great service. As buyers we need to continue to carefully consider the demand our purchases place on the environment but it's good to know that Amazon can align with this goal shoud we choose to.I look forward to seeing more sustainably powered vans adopted and encouragement for smaller local and quality goods sellers promoted on the home page.","March 13, 2024"

So, after much scanning of the web page, which appears deliberately designed to lead the eye towards their commands to buy, buy, buy, you eventually find that delivery is £4 on Wednesday, free on Thursday, click it (big deal huh? one day) recheck it, and finally, buy cat food, not Prime, with no delivery charge, promised 5 minutes or so before.

Here's what happened here and hoping these fools get exposed for what they are doing there and Bezos gets his head out of his butt and takes a further and strong look as to how his operation is being run there and whom he's hiring as customer service staff there, aka cheap labor from third world countries who can barely speak English or be able to formulate a sentence properly...here is what happened to me recently...I would like to voice a complaint against the biggest online retailer in the world, that being Amazon.com. So in a nutshell this past week, I ordered a Coke Zero mini fridge they were selling and there are two different designs to them, one has a bottle on it and the other has a full logo splurged horizontally across the door, and thinking I was finally going to receive the bottled version after two other attempts at getting this resulted in returning them both back for full refunds, a few leadership team members had promised and assured me I would finally be receiving the item that is pictured and when I received the item late last night at home (1/20/2024), I received yet the same item I received the other two times over and now having to return that as well. I have been in constant battles with their inept & incompetent customer service division & I have requested to speak to higher ups there to rectify this problem, but they have done nothing but lead me astray like a puppy dog, ignoring my requests and then accusing me of lying to them that I actually received the correct item when I did not & I showed them the two links in question, side to side and pinpointed this in as many ways as possible, but still, they refuse to do anything to help me out and I have just about had it with them. I truly feel they are practicing fraudulent and deceptive advertising at that website and I am at my wits end with them to boot! I do not appreciate being accused of something I didn't even do here and I could care less whether promotional credit was used or not on this item to cover said costs of the product, it was still the wrong item shipped out to me and nothing has been done to rectify this mess. I submitted further proof & evidence as they had requested to show them I was not making any of this stuff up and I never heard back from them, so I re-contacted them to no avail, so hoping this situation gets remedied this once & for all! They're oblivious to never wanting to admit they were at fault for anything but rather, blame the customers and now they're asking for solid proof too?! Well, they got it as this kind of chicanery needs to cease right here and now!All this over a mini fridge they're selling that has two different logos to it and when you order it from them, what is displayed versus what one actually does receive are literally quite different in so many ways and aspects, as it's beyond comprehension with them. Just a sad excuse for an organization to be doing any of this to their loyal and faithful customers.UPDATE on 1/23/2024 at 2 PM CT...Well, I have to give them credit where credit is due as it took a major interaction with their corporate team and CEO to get to the bottom of this craziness and I am happy to report that they came through with fixing this messed up and screwed up order and they even offered humblest apologies for accusing me of lying about everything associated with that order and what I received and such. I still would be very cautious about doing business with them, no matter how well known they are as their customer service division really needs a huge and major overall and to bring in people who can actually speak the English language properly and truly give a damn about helping their customers who keep that business afloat on a daily basis. Serious re-training of their staff needs to be done at once as they all seem in quite a bit of a hurry to conclude chat and phone conversations without properly delving into the key issues one might have with their orders. I'll change my rating to a 4 star review from one as they acted appropriately but again, thank goodness for getting in touch with their corporate division and CEO or I'd still be having issues with getting this nonsense solved to this very day, but it's now done and completed and let's hope they don't screw up any more of my orders from here on out. I can hope, right?!","January 20, 2024"

Through the years the merchandise and service was excellent. But recently Sellers have been dishonest regarding conditions of merchandise offered. Most recently a seller described an out of print Spanish textbook as LIKE NEW condition with no writing on pages. Upon receipt I went through entire book finding ten pages filled with penciled in answers on top and margins. Even some in pen. I immediately took photos of everything and returned for refund. Most recently since last week I bought a Book and six cassette Greek course...described as having just a few loose pages. Upon unwrapping the book an entire section in one piece of 65 PAGES fell out of the book onto my lap. Now both the seller and Amazon are refusing a partial refund (for book) cassettes are good. I was left with no recourse but to register complaint with the credit card itself.... hopefully with positive outcome for me. And I agree with other commenters regarding customer service phone calls.....they're based out of the USA with accents I can barely understand their English. WTH.

My nightmare revolves around the delivery service that I receive, being a PRIME MEMBER.  Because of increased problems with 'Porch Pirates', I have specific instructions that when a delivery has been made, that the driver take one additional step and ring our doorbell. When the doorbell is rung, our front door idms opened and the delivery is found and brought into the house.  Time and time again, that simple, additional, step is not made and deliveries linger at the door, sometimes overnight!  I call to speak with a 'LIVE AGENT', and after providing them with the same information, time after time, in the end, all that can be done, is to escalate the matter up the management line.  Promises that the problem will be corrected are made time after time.  The next delivery or two are made according to the specific delivery instructions and then it's back to the same old 'operatus morandi' is followed.During my last call to Amazon, yesterday, I advised them that the first time that I have a delivery come up missing, that will be the LAST order that I place with Amazon and my PRIME MEMBERSHIP will be cancelled.","January 16, 2024"

I have never had one bad experience with Amazon and have used them for years. Maybe people have been unlucky with the delivery drivers in certain areas but in my experience quite frankly what is there not to like with Amazon you get your orders on time. Returns are free and easy to do. Refunds are quick. On the other hand my experience of Chinese companies is the opposite. You try returning an item and getting a refund. Good luck with that one. 🤣  They are mainly based in Shanghai or USA. Number one so no free returns. They wear you out haggling because they just want you to accept their shoddy goods and go away so you lose your money. So you return your goods. Next they say they have not received them. So then they ask for proof of sending so you send that. Then they say they haven't received that. Finally sorted by Paypal but took 2 months of my valuable time.

I won’t be taking in any more parcels for that property from now on and will hang onto the one I have in case they realise they haven’t received it and come and ask if I have it here. What on earth would I do if they did that and I told them “ oh sorry, Amazon said I could just keep it “ I would be mortified.So my advice is, don’t take in anyone else’s parcels unless you know the neighbour well enough to know they haven’t moved house!","January 07, 2024"

I live not all that far from one of their delivery facilities, so my items arrive often sooner than they guesstimated.  I've had no trouble making returns for the times I needed to.  My recent experience is for a food item I've purchased many many times.  During COVID, the price rose & shipping times lengthened.  The price basically rose from $8 to $13 since COVID, which I accept.  Recently I re-ordered, as part of a larger order.  The other items arrived promptly, but this one was due to ship later with different dates given.  This time it didn't & I gave almost two weeks before contacting them.  That went well as I requested a call to me, which I got promptly,  The agent spoke clear English & understood what happened without further questions to me.  She processed a refund to my credit card, because she said, that replacement wasn't possible on this & I could shop for a new one.So looking, I only saw it for $32 - - over double what I had paid.  The trouble with Amazon, you often don't know who the seller is because so much is ""fullfilled by Amazon.""  So maybe the seller never sent it, realizing they could get a higher price due to some shortage.  So I didn't buy it for $32 & looked elsewhere.

He very kindly came into my porch to hide the package so my surprise wouldn't be ruined! How thoughtful!!

However, I bought a used Nintendo Switch Lite that came not working from Amazon Warehouse specifically. Upon setting up a return, I see they aren’t refunding the full price of the item. This simply isn’t fair business. I hope to buy elsewhere in the future. Update: I was refunded the full price minus shipping. While this is partially unfair since the item didn’t power on, I found it was an acceptable outcome, and will continue to shop on Amazon. I probably won’t buy used items there though. I’m also adding a star to the review (from 3/5 to 4/5). Another update: I’m no longer going to be shopping on Amazon. They sent me the wrong size shirt and no one is home when trying to correct things. While I was able to get a refund on one mis-sized shirt, I am thinking the other shirt I ordered will be incorrect sized as well. Both shirts were print on demand.

My efforts resulted in more than thirty reviews appearing on Amazon, many rated as either “Top Positive Review” or “Top Critical Review”. But when I submitted a review of “The Last Politician” by Franklin Foer, I got a terse email from Amazon that it could not be posted “because it doesn’t meet our guidelines for one or more of these reasons: Profanity, Harassment, Hate Speech, Sexual Content, Illegal Activity, Private Information”. This had never happened before, and I was quite surprised. I went to the link that showed the “Community Guidelines” and read all six pages, scratching my head, trying to figure what I’d done wrong and then I realized the issue was politics. The person checking my review was apparently an extreme liberal so I made some changes that I thought might let my piece “pass” and I resubmitted it. But I soon realized this was a waste of time because I could make changes piecemeal again and again, but without knowing exactly what in my 850 word review was the ”problem”, my efforts would be fruitless.How could I get the nameless and faceless Amazon person behind the “wizard’s curtain” to tell me what to do? I remembered seeing on my “Author’s Page” a place where I could recommend books. I’d never used this feature before but now got the idea to cite Franklin Foer’s book as a “Recommendation”, writing in the comments, “I wrote a review of this book that did not pass the Amazon Moderator and I hope they will tell me what to change.” This was an act of desperation because I truly wanted to get my review posted and I was willing to make rewrites but had to have some guidance, sort of like we got from our high school English teacher who would take a red pencil and underline the problem.Apparently, my ploy with Amazon backfired because I soon got an email saying my post was “outside of our guidelines” and “consider this to be a first warning.” Amazon’s ire was about the book recommendation I’d put on my author’s page (specifically the comments showing Amazon in a bad light) since this was the only “post” I’d ever made other than book reviews.This was going nowhere, and I was not going to play Amazon’s games. I replied to the email, saying, “if you cannot tell me what I am doing wrong I will cancel my book advertising, Amazon Prime, and the Amazon prime credit card and quit making purchases from Amazon.” Six days later I got a reply email saying, “You have repeatedly posted content that violates our Community Guidelines . . . [and therefore] we’ve removed your ability to participate in Community features.” This was untrue because I’d only made one post, the one where I said, “I hope they [Amazon Moderator] will tell me what to change [in the review that had been rejected].”Unfortunately, all the book reviews I’d posted on Amazon over the years were deleted. This was quite disappointing because I’d spent hundreds of dollars on dozens of books, reading them closely over countless hours in order to write honest and informed book reviews and now my work had come to naught. I truly doubt that anyone has put more effort(both in the reading and the writing) into creating a book review than I have. Amazon’s actions have not only hurt me but are a disservice to millions of readers who rely on quality reviews to make wise decisions in their book purchases.As I said earlier, I’ve submitted critical assessments of other books to Amazon and never had a problem and I must conclude the current issue is over politics, simply having a different opinion. While I did say some positives about the author, I also faulted him for being almost sycophantic toward Biden. What he wrote was an uncritical fluff piece and I called it as such. The review, as written, would be passable to any reasonable person and there is nothing out of bounds in it. I read the book thoroughly and wrote an honest, critical review with no malice or evil intent. For anyone interested, a google search of “book reviews of ‘The Last Politician’” will take you to Goodreads where you’ll find my piece and you can decide for yourself.","October 18, 2023"

I had hoped that some that corporate body would keep them in check. Futile hope I guess but it's not the consumer's responsibility to organise & sacrifice themselves & their accounts for this. But I draw the line at such insanely poor customer service. I'm not sure when it died but the customer service in this place has been murdered. I've spoken to 5 different agents today on their live chat - over a span of 12 hours - to figure out & sort a seemingly innocuous issue; they create random accounts for each of your devices. I've been promised that a specialist would call me back 4 times & each time, I've been left waiting with no such call coming my way. At a certain point, being 'happy to help' is the most faceless thing you can say to someone who's tired of the constant BS & lies.

In my experience of being an Amazon user stretching back for many years now, I’ve never really encountered or experienced anything other than the most excellent and reliable customer service, great choice & value, and excellent delivery turn arounds. I did once have a blip, something went very wrong (obviously these things will happen), however after contacting Amazon, straightaway the issue got satisfactorily resolved and I was even provided with a complete refund and agreeable compensation. I was so highly impressed with the professional manner in which that particular issue was dealt with. I find more and more these days so many high street brand stores often only provide top selling products with limited to zero choices being readily made available to the consumer and that includes their internet shopping sites. Time after time I’ve visited many of these companies and then swiftly moved across to Amazon. Being with Amazon the opposite is true, so many wide ranging products, such huge variety, so many obscure products, and the opportunity to shop at my convenience at anytime day or night so for these reasons thats why Amazon always tends getting my money and vote. The only negatives for me are:- I consider it’s important that people understand that some employees both in-house and self employed aren’t always being treated lawfully in so far as the meaning contained within the UK Employment Act and this is an extremely important issue that I consider should have a much higher priority within their internal HR department. And finally, the often totally ridiculous amount of packaging involved and I’ve never fully understood why this issue isn’t being more swiftly addressed.","October 10, 2023"

It sits on our small porch  by the front door and is usually unlocked until items have been delivered. The box has been admired by delivery personnel and visitors alike. My instructions always include the key code.  The problem is three-fold 1. Amazon does not provide an option to leave items in a secure box in the delivery section when we order so I have to adapt how I give the instructions - but they’re there. 2. Drivers don’t read the instructions. 3. Despite the box being clearly labelled with ‘Amazon Deliveries etc’  many delivery drivers leave parcels on top of the box, at the side of the box or even elsewhere and photograph it. Some items are quite valuable. Not all drivers do this so it is annoying when it happens. It has also gone on for too long and is NOT acceptable.

Extract fans delivered were not the model I ordered but I only noticed after the return period - Full refund.Diamond drill, should have been 5, only one in pack - Full refund, kept the one drillI would generally prefer to buy things on Amazon, especially electronics that can go wrong as I know I will get a refund with little fuss.So in my experience I really can't fault Amazon","October 03, 2023"

However, it was defective. So, rather than get a refund, I ordered a replacement on 9/2/23. The package was supposed to arrive in two to three days. I am still waiting for the item. It is now almost 9/18. I am a Prime customer, and have spent quite a lot of money with them over the years. I've called their customer service numerous times. I keep getting the same scripted answers. Sounds like a run-around to me. The item is in transit, they keep repeating. When I checked the USPS tracking history, the last date is 14 days ago, on 9/4/23, stating awaiting receipt of item. In other words, the Post Office hasn't even received the package. Even Amazon's own website says the package may be lost, and to request a refund or replacement. I was told to call back on 9/20 for them to investigate further. That's 18 days since I ordered the item. What a joke. I barely can understand these reps over the phone. Sound familiar? This is the last time I will ever order a big-ticket item from them. Before, Amazon promptly refunded me or sent out a replacement right away. This is how you lose loyal customers!Post Script (9/26/23): I was finally issued a refund,18 days after I purchased the watch. The item never arrived, nor did the USPS ever receive my package. I got an email from their customer service saying that the package was deemed 'not deliverable' and sent back to an Amazon facility. Just what I was telling them all along. As a Prime customer, I should not have to wait nearly three weeks. Amazon could have sent me a replacement. Again, this is not a good way to treat their loyal customers.","September 15, 2023"

Nothing could be further from the truth. Late packages, items packaged poorly and unprotected, some wrong items sent and many package delivery drivers that won't follow placement instructions. Add to all of this, there have been many product's pricing that is an utter rip off. 100's % higher and Amazon does NOTHING about it like their policies say that they will. I have had inferior products advertising original brands which I had to return or fight with the manufacturing company after the Amazon 30 days return window closed on me. No one seems either to care much or want to do a better job these days. Sad but true. I know many will dispute me here, but that's been my honest experiences.","September 04, 2023"

Ups charges a ton for a package pickup if you are not a company and live on a normal street.Many of the things I have bought was from a third party seller even through they say it's through Amazon services. They hide it until you need to return something and see that it is from a third party vendor.I don't bother buying stuff from there unless I have a gift card to spend from the holidays. It's an overpriced alibaba now and I can buy the exact same stuff off of temu, alibaba or the dollar store for half the price with better service.

The fabric is soft, comfortable, and of high quality, making it a pleasure to wear all day. Plus, it's even better in person than in the pictures - the color is vibrant and hasn't faded after multiple washes.What truly impressed me was the attention to detail in the design. The stitching is impeccable, and I haven't encountered any loose threads or issues with the seams. This piece not only looks fantastic but feels well-made.The delivery was prompt, and the packaging was eco-friendly, which I appreciate.Overall, I couldn't be happier with my purchase. The CATHY womens casual short sleeve T-Shirts is now a staple in my wardrobe, and I've received numerous compliments whenever I wear it. I'll definitely be exploring more clothing options from this brand in the future. Highly recommend![Hafsat Abdulkadir]","September 04, 2023"

I have an issue with having to send things back via UPS, we don't have a UPS store here. You can, however, print out a label they will send you, and you can put it in the UPS Dropbox, however we don't have those and I don't have a printer! So if I get things that don't fit or I just don't like them I cannot send them back and I'm stuck with them. It gets old. The second issue I have is their packaging. Most of the time you get 1 or 2 small items in a large box, what a waste. sometimes they come in plastic envelopes and are smashed because there's no protection.I'd rather have small boxes because then they fit in the parcel lockers at the Post Office and I don't have to take off of work early to go pick up my packages because they don't fit. I can recycle the cardboard, I just think it's stupid to put a calendar in a box that you could fit 10 pairs of shoes in it.

When we finally reach someone, they do not have time and give you the runaround. Basically, whenever you need real support, there is none.For example (latest to date): ordered 10 automation devices. 2 were delivered. The last 8 to expect on 10-Aug. It is now 27-Aug and still no update. Finally reached someone and after lots of chatting, the staff stated ""It is stuck"" (no more explanation). ""You will get an e-mail when it is released...""

Maybe sometimes even unrealistic expectations,  for instance most of the bad reviews on here seem to be people trying to get a refund on a gift card which obviously may have limitations on every retailer's individual policy but overall when it comes to a seamless online Internet shopping experience.  In terms of being the dominant department store, I will have to say overall I'm pretty happy one thing I would definitely recommend is checking out the most recent reviews taking the time and not going by the thousands of reviews from years ago which might be fake. Make sure to compare prices because if I have one complaint is the fact that Amazon is not always cheaper than in the stores .Honestly, I don't really expect it to be the cheapest because there is that added cost of shipping and for the convenience and I'm prepared to pay for that sometimes, and sometimes I'm not.

I love Amazon for the gift of better living, and unlimited supply of products brought to my doorstep. They do this all day/everyday!! They are very generous with their return policies and more. I had never seen such negative reviews before. I will say this to all of the anti-Amazon customer service feed backers, you wouldn't realize their sweet, helpful acts of customer service kindness, if it was wrapped in hundred dollar bills. Put a little love and appreciation for Amazon in your heart, and be a lover not an ass with them and hopefully you'll come to the light that shines so bright in my life because of Amazon Prime and every soul that works hard everyday to make our lives better and easier.

In the beginning you could do a straight up search and you would get something close to what you were searching for. Now no matter how you set your search you get anything they want to show you most not having to do with what you are looking for. They expect you to go through pages and pages of things that are not what you are looking for and you may never see what you were searching for. I have short legs and need 9"" or shorter shorts to wear to work; when I did a search for 9"" cargo shorts I got, 7 pages of 48 each, all kinds of shorts some cargo some plain and some gym shorts but nothing in 9 inch inseam, or that had 9 inch in the description. Amazon shows up in the Google search as having and describes them as 9 inch inseams. If you click on the link it takes you to just plain cargo shorts and no 9 inch inseams. I am tired of being treated as one of the cows and you will get what we decide what you will see and like it. I sorry I don't like it.  I hope Amazon will read this and think about how they wast so much of the public's time. I'm sure they think their time is valuable, our is too.","August 01, 2023"

Amazon must have known that they had no stock, their stock must be computerised for the robots to be able to fetch it off the shelves. SO liars again.

I’ve notice more and more that my items have been delayed by 3-4 days (even longer) or I never get them at all. Or the item is marked as shipped, which pays the vendor and then it never moves. You track shipping and all it says is shipped or a label was made. In my opinion, Amazon is to blame even if it’s a third-party seller.

Must have purchased thousands of items from them, next day delivery, generally good quality and if it wasn’t it was priced low anyway or from one of their affiliated suppliers, which they can’t control fully, it’s impossible. The main thing is every single item I’ve returned over the years has been  refunded straight away, no questions asked, even food products. No quibbles like virtually every other supplier who I have had the misfortune of dealing with. They lose Amazon win. 100 percent the best in the business and their revenues prove it. Argos was 10 times the size of Amazon just over a decade ago. Who is laughing now? Great business.","June 23, 2023"

I spent a lot of time explaining the problem to multiple people during communication with them and had a hard time getting in touch with the manager. The manager's responses were unrelated to the issue most of the time, leaving me confused. In addition, I found it difficult to locate the UK team. the Prime membership service was not as practical for me and I had to wait 7-9 business days for each return to recover the money, while the payment was instant. Delivery was also often unreliable, with packages sometimes lost or delayed.I wish Amazon would value customer feedback, improve their customer service, and provide more efficient and accurate solutions. Also, I hope they can optimize the Prime membership service process to ensure that the refund process is faster and smoother.

It was supposed to be delivered on 6th June 2023.I received an delivery confirmation on email. It stated the parcel had been delivered at reception. This is somewhat suspect because there is no reception area or anywhere safe to leave it, except with a neighbour. It wasn’t left with one of them. I enquired about this on Amazon chat. To be told the delivery status was updated too early. Strange… Apologies were given and the new delivery date was 8th of June 2023.Surprise, surprise…the parcel still didn’t arrive on 8th June. I called Amazon customer service and informed them about this. The customer advisor stated they need to speak to their manager. I explained they are in breach of contract the goods never arrived and funds have been taken. I asked for a full refund.To be fair, after the advisor had spoke to their boss. They stated I would have a refund in up to 5 working days. They also told me I could keep the items if they arrived. Of course, the items never arrived.I received a confirmation email of my refund being processed. Thankfully, I received a full refund including the postage and packaging I paid for too.

As author, they can be the worst to deal with. You ask them the same question three or more times and they copy and paste the answer before giving you more information. They give you 5 days to prove you own copyright over your own books especially those published on another website or you use public domain content. When using public domain, they will request you for a signed document to prove you have exclusive rights to use the materials freely. It took a whole day to change one book's content because of this requirement from them. Everything I gave them was not accepted as proof. The issue is there is no way to prove a public domain content version of the World English Bible to them. All the sites that I found says it is public domain. If there was a better place to publish with all their benefits, I would choose that one over them. I just like that I can still get royalties when people read my ebooks and they have ads to advertise your books. I can distribute globally and people buy my books there more than other platforms. Otherwise, I don't like them. They are troublesome to work with. I heard others complain about their author experience with them.

Previously, it was like everything I purchased was coming late. Today, I get a message that my package will be late. Please, let's not start this cycle again. I'm leaving a review based on the company itself. I would like to make a suggestion. When, a Primes member orders items within a certain time frame to have them delivered by a certain day, that's what we expect. Some of us are business owners, work from home, and have projects to complete. Paying for a service just to receive items late is a mute point. Here's my suggestion. For every order a prime member does not receive by the correct time frame indicated, you refund half the purchase price or give a $15 Amazon credit automatically. This means prime members should not have to call in and request this credit. You should have a designated team who keeps track of shipping to ensure orders will be delivered on time and when they are not, you credit the prime membes' account and send the notification of received our items late. How does that sound. Because $5 isn't enough. Truth be told $15 isn't either. However, it's more that $5.","May 31, 2023"

Searching for what I want is easy, and the reviews are helpful when deciding on whether to purchase or not and I’m on the fence regarding a product. Returns are easy when dropping off an item at a return center. Just do the return request online, they send you a bar code and you just drop off the item and they scan your phone. Done. Thirty seconds. Don’t even need a box or anything. Prime membership is worth it to me when it comes to the shipping, and prime also comes with the amazon prime tv and I’m certain there are more perks that other people use that I don’t even use that are included with the prime membership. There have been times when something didn’t arrive on time as planned, and the story I’m telling myself is that even the best systems and processes will not be executed perfectly every time. So it is what it is. And I choose to appreciate that the majority of the time, I get what I want and it’s delivered properly as it should be. Well done amazon drivers. Well done amazon customer service. Well done Jeff Bezos. Well done amazon sellers.There are times when I think, I need to go out and go shopping. There are times when I think, I can so order that amazon and get on with my day and focus on other stuff. I like that I can purchase gifts, have them  wrapped, shipped, etc. and bada bing bada bang. Done with a few taps on my phone.Many small business owners and local mom and pop shops may get jacked and may not be able to compete. That’s a challenge everyone needs to overcome. For avoidance of doubt, I do shop at local owned stores and give them my business. I also shop at amazon and give those Amazon sellers my business. I see a bunch of negative reviews here and they are recent reviews. We receive amazon orders a few times each week, so speaking from my experience which is overall positive, I give 4 stars.","May 26, 2023"

While Amazon offers numerous advantages and convenience, it also has its fair share of drawbacks that need to be acknowledged. Here's my breakdown of the pros and cons:Pros:1. Vast Product Selection: One of Amazon's biggest strengths is its unparalleled product range. From electronics to clothing, home goods to books, you can find almost anything you need on their platform.2. Competitive Prices: Amazon's marketplace fosters competition among sellers, often resulting in competitive prices. You can often find great deals and discounts on various products.3. Convenience and Speed: Amazon's Prime membership offers fast and free shipping on eligible items, making it incredibly convenient for time-sensitive purchases. Additionally, their user-friendly interface and seamless checkout process enhance the overall shopping experience.4. Customer Reviews: The abundance of customer reviews provides valuable insights and helps make informed purchasing decisions. It's beneficial to hear others' experiences before making a purchase.Cons:1. Counterfeit Products: Due to the sheer number of sellers on Amazon, there is a risk of encountering counterfeit or low-quality items. While Amazon takes measures to combat this issue, it remains a concern for some buyers.2. Third-Party Seller Discrepancies: As Amazon allows third-party sellers, inconsistencies in product quality, customer service, and shipping practices can occur. It's essential to research sellers and read reviews before making a purchase.3. Environmental Impact: The rapid growth of Amazon's operations has raised concerns about its environmental impact, such as packaging waste and carbon emissions from delivery vehicles. They have made some efforts to address these concerns, but there is still room for improvement.4. Worker Conditions: Over the years, there have been reports and controversies regarding the working conditions at Amazon's fulfillment centers. These issues highlight the need for better worker treatment and labor practices.Overall, Amazon remains a convenient and popular platform for online shopping, but it's important to approach it with awareness of its limitations. Being an informed shopper and understanding the potential drawbacks can help mitigate any negative experiences. Amazon's continuous improvements and addressing of these concerns would undoubtedly contribute to a better customer experience and make it an even more reliable platform in the future.","August 10, 2022"

It seems that those taking customer service calls lack knowledge of how their review system works. I have been trying to review 3 items I've recently purchased and Amazon is blocking me from doing so. The stated reason is that I'm not a verified buyer. If I purchase it on the Amazon site, how much more verified is that. When things like this happen, it feels like there is something nefarious going on between the seller and Amazon.I was told that I needed to wait for 24 hours after delivery before I could leave a review, but they couldn't explain why I've been able to review other products minutes after delivery.I was told that I would receive an email regarding my issue. It's been ten days and still no email. Very frustrating and very suspicious.","May 01, 2023"

While I can't deny the consistently good quality of their products and services, I can't overlook the growing trend of additional charges for certain features. It has left me feeling moderately satisfied with my overall experience.One aspect that has always stood out for me is the impressive range of products available on Amazon. Whether I'm looking for electronics, home goods, or even niche items, I can usually find what I need. The quality of the products I've purchased has generally been reliable, and I appreciate the convenience of having everything delivered right to my doorstep.However, my contentment has been somewhat dampened by the increasing number of features that come at an extra cost. Previously, I enjoyed the simplicity of a Prime membership, which included fast shipping and access to a decent selection of movies, TV shows, and books. Unfortunately, it seems like more and more perks are being pulled behind additional paywalls, which can be frustrating.For instance, the introduction of Amazon Prime Video Channels, which require separate subscriptions for certain content providers, has made the streaming experience less appealing. It feels like I'm being nickel-and-dimed for every additional service, making it harder to justify the extra expenses.","May 01, 2023"

And why isn't there a link somewhere about the Amazon website to contact customer service?  Why does it take about 5 minutes (not exaggerating) to drill down, answer questions, meet criteria and generally jump through hoops in order to get to the point where you can ask a question of a customer service rep?  I get that its HUGE but does that exonerate them from basic business practices and being available to their customers?  Is it impossible to imagine that there are some questions that can't be answered by the options they offer up in a list?The COVID pandemic wreaked havoc upon society worldwide and created new standards and expectations for and about work, workers, customers, customer services, etc. and during that time it was impossible to fulfill Prime membership benefits like 2-day shipping, but it's long since and they've not yet reinstated the 2-day shipping policy. Go to amazon and look up prime membership benefits and the list includes video and kindle and music benefits but, all of those come with a monthly subscription fee separate from the $139 annual fee for Prime membership.  The shipping benefits listed for Prime Membership reflect two-day shipping on ""select"" items, so perhaps just the ""select"" item list got pared back during COVID and has never been 're-augmented'?Whatever the answer, I'm not sure Amazon prime membership is worth it anymore - certainly not if you're paying for it monthly; but perhaps even the annual membership doesn't make sense?It's rare that I need anything the next day or even two-days later and I'll frequently select delivery on my amazon delivery day, but when I do need something within' two-days, I'm finding Walmart to be more receptive to those needs (and they often deliver the next day AND on Sundays). Me thinks Amazon has gotten too big for it's britches and forgets the trail-blazing they once did only to foist buggy service upon us now. And don't get me started on dropping Amazon returns at a Whole Foods, especially one in NYC  The Upper East Side Whole Foods at 87th & 3rd has a huge Amazon Returns sign with that big smiley swoosh beneath it, so you know you're in the right place, but there's no additional signage to tell you to go to the Mezzanine which is accessible only by elevator (don't take the escalator bc it bypasses the Mezz altogether).","May 09, 2023"

How have people had this many bad experiences with Amazon?I purchased regularly from Amazon and I’m a prime member. I’ve never had issues with returns that couldn’t be resolved with a phone call. I have received hundreds of excellent products through their site.I’m not thrilled that they have a monopoly in this industry, but their innovation has made our lives easier. It’s amazing they can deliver products on the same day you order. And with no fee! I’ve been able to order items that I’d never find in a local store.I don’t love that. The majority of their products are made in China. But that’s true for every brick and mortar store as well. It isn’t Amazon‘s fault that factories have been outsourced to another country.I love that anyone who wants to order from Whole Foods can do so through Amazon. I’ve done this once and it was helpful.The return process couldn’t be easier. The length of time allowed for returns around the Christmas holiday is wonderful. I do wish they’d allow a longer window for returns during the rest of the year. With such high sales volume it would likely create chaos though.I’m a fan even if I don’t agree with all of their practices. Thank you for making my daily life more manageable.","April 20, 2023"

They don't even try to call to ask how to find your apartment or bother looking for your apartment. I know getting a refund or sometimes a replacement if you're lucky to get a replacement fast at least with me it had been easy. That was when I used to live in apartments not anymore. Now, issues with orders? No, I always get what I want even without prime I got what I ordered but of course I had to wait for it. I ordered two chest binders for myself, it was easy to return one & repurchase a second one. Never got anything used or broken, I mean shampoos or liquid soaps always tend to leak & I wish it was more protected from leaking but I guess it can't be helped. I did for a fact have a family member who has had issues with returns. Don't know if it's the sellers being scammers, but whenever you do return something always keep the tracking receipt from UPS or USPS because even though you did return everything sometimes you'll get your money taken as if you never returned it. Then you get an email threatening you about your money being taken because the sellers ""never received the items"" so always keep your tracking numbers & take pictures of your returns. Sometimes calling customer service is useless, I always go for the chat it's easier & faster in my opinion. This is my review, I'm not saying it's terrible to shop there but it isn't always the best.","February 27, 2023"

The reason i LOVED amazon is their great delivery service and speed. That is no longer a thing. Where i am anyways. We dont get the amazon delivery trucks. And it takes forever. But im still being charged the prime fee. I always got my pkg with the amazon drivers. With ups its ALWAYS an issue. Which is why i avoided MOST online services. Now that amazon is using ups/fedex for every delivery no matter how small or large im cancelling. WHY AM I PAYING PRIME FEES. Its not worth it. I could shop literally anywhere else atp.

I researched online, and Amazon has upwards of 60 to 70% Asian sellers now (USA site): It's ridiculous - their clothing size measurements are often WAY off (a small in a shirt was 53"" in the bust! I wear an XL and have a 45"" bust); they often don't list the fiber content at all (one item was listed as 100% cotton AND 35% polyester); If you don't read carefully, your item(s) could take a month+ to get because they're shipped from China!; The BROKEN ENGLISH in MOST of product descriptions is absolutely ridiculous, plus wrong color names, duplicate listings of the exact same product, wrong items sent, cm measurements instead of inches, long driveling descriptions like ""You look pretty, sexy for you, so sensual, best dress make you feel luxurious, husband like you better, wear to party, office, vacation, pool, shopping, best dress for your wear...."" . Oh, it gets so freakin' old. For once I'd like to see a whole bunch of LITERATE listings for products.2. Searching for products on Amazon is an absolute joke: You cannot pick your own price-range (it has to be 25$+); when you do a manual search for a specific brand, the results still show off-brands and often will be loosely related to the search you entered; The Asian sellers have illiterate store names: ""Floerns"", Cufech"", ""Linkiom"", ""BTFBM"", ""Dokootoo"", ""Romwe"" ""Micticsi"", and they're everywhere on the site.3. I'm convinced Amazon purposefully rearranges customer product reviews, since the review dates are often out of date order (not sequential); There's absolutely no way 10's of thousands of products all have 5-star reviews before you would see any negative reviews for those thousands of products! At the top of a product review page you can see the percentage of 1-5 star reviews, yet I have had to go in as far as 18-20 pages of product reviews to find ANY ratings under 5 stars. Absolutely ridiculous.4. Amazon Prime isn't worth $140 a year (it went up from $120 in 2022): Prime Video is supposedly free, but most of the videos COST money to watch. I don't use digital books, so that's not a perk for me; I can still get products delivered within 3 days or so, sometimes earlier, and I can find things for a good, low price WITHOUT PRIME!

I just did not receive a shaver from a third-party while Amazon collected my money. They wouldn’t return my money and charge it back to the company that shipped me the item or try to show me home I didn’t get it but the point of the matter is Amazon is great to take money but they don’t care  about you as a customer anymore not since Bezos left and he had a new CEO, the new CEO is a piece of crap. He moved his return situation out of the country frustrated the crap out of your customers even though I have spent over half million dollars for them both corporately and personally for the last 10 years, but they are not good anymore so I am now Elderly I’m 77 years old. I’m retired and I am going to have to change because they were going to send stuff to my place at some point but now they’re not getting a credit for anything I don’t receive as a problem now they just want to figure its and blame somebody else because they’re trying to lower the cost, well, it’s gonna cost of  them business. The bottom line is they denied my claim. I didn’t get the merchandise that I paid them for, they sent me back to the shipper which is a problematic situation, so I’m just fed up with her but because I’m elderly and I now live in a community. I don’t even receive my things anymore and when they deliver from local service locations, you’re 4050 miles from where I live they now do not pay any attention to leaving them at the front desk delivery area between the hours of Monday through Thursday till 4 PM and Friday till 12 PM very much that area  and pay attention to the instructions were put on your file. Is there any rain in anyway driver comes at 7 PM, 10 PM whatever I can’t leave it so can you get inside and get my crap do you think I’m really credit? No I’m not getting credit for being lazy and not reading their stuff so there you have it dumb people so he accomplish this. He got his money but his bonus, as soon is not made from nothing else but the return policy reductions he’s got his nobody’s gonna be getting anything anymore. and  therefore he’s done so screw you Bezos apparently is one of the richest people in the world now so screw you.

They're no longer the cheapest (I can usually find a better deal elsewhere), the quality is low, and sellers can easily manipulate the system and sneak by. #2 It's nearly impossible to complain to or communicate with Amazon for any reason. How can customers hold Amazon accountable without a forum to do so? #3 Items sold and shipped by Amazon often use USPS, which I won't know until I go to track the order. USPS won't deliver packages to my door...but the whole reason I'm ordering online is for delivery service to my door (it's very difficult for me to get out of the house). #4 Amazon's search feature is not great. I usually have to use Google search and Google lens to find the product with an Amazon shopping link. #5 I feel like I am actually the product that Amazon is selling with its invasiveness online. #6 Two stars instead of one because of how easy it is to get refunds for most products.","March 29, 2023"

It's also not cheap but those very few times that the package is lost or undelivered they refund you immediately through their very efficient customer service.

Me and this address share the same street name and number but I am at an apartment they are at a house, so I don't get how there is confusion there. Well anyways, I wanted to get my refund because they shipped it out to the wrong place. I was always told they were taking notes of this and were going to make sure that it doesn't happen again the last two times that they shipped to the wrong place and now I am being told that I cant get a refund due to the risk of loss policy which is a bunch of bs. Every time I have to go through customer support, I have to deal with people who doesn't understand my issue. They keep saying its been delivered to the right place but on the tracker I can see the exact address they are shipping to. I have had issues with this constantly from them, the first time I had ordered I ended up getting real irritated because they were not understanding my issue or problem. They kept saying that I wont get a refund for a item I paid more than 150$ for, had to call like 10 times before I could get my refund. I am starting to rethink my choice of having a prime membership. At this point, it seems like their customer service is not going to get any better. I hope no one else has to go through the bad service issues I have had.Edit: They fixed my issue but this time it took around 20 calls. Almost all of the conversations I have had were very stressful because they continued to miss the problems that I had, they kept saying it was delivered without even checking. One guy I spoke to sounded sarcastic when I finally asked to speak to a higher up. His reply ""Good luck with that because they are going to tell you the same thing that I am telling you.""

I feel duty bound to warn other customers about items I've purchased that are advertized fraudulently or defective, which Amazon does not allow me to do. I expect Amazon as a middleman service suffers from conflict of interest when it comes to the various companies for which they brokers, so it censors reviews for the businesses it's too close to, in order to protect its sells. This is siding with these companies that sell substandard merchandise against Amazon members, and should immediately stop. Ever paying Amazon shopper should have an unhindered right to review the items they paid for.2) Amazon listings needs to clarify differences in sizing scale when merch is manufactured in different countries, which it most often fails to do. For example, I cannot tell you number of times I purchased items manufactured in China, according to Chinese sizing scale - which is about 2-sizes smaller than US sizing - without being warned by Amazon. The result being, merchandise That doesn't fit - clothes, backpack, laptop case - I either haveto go through headache of returning, just givaway, or trash.","March 06, 2023"

I can only assume that people come here to vent rather than to share a typical experience. For all its faults, Amazon is a very customer-focused company.About a year ago, I ordered a set of 2 monitors and a 2-monitor stand in a pack. The pack with 2 monitors and a stand was cheaper than just one monitor plus the stand, which seemed suspicious. As I should have expected, only one monitor (and the stand) arrived. I contacted Amazon and learned that this was a typo (only 1 monitor was intended), but they honored the order anyway and shipped a second monitor for free. Amazon customer service is empowered to fix problems, unlike customer service in most companies. This is a typical Amazon experience, despite the bizarre rating on this page.","April 12, 2022"

However, the 2-day shipping that used to be reliable is no longer reliable.  I would prefer they lower the cost of Prime and just NOT PROMISE 2-day delivery any longer. I understand we are in difficult economic times but if a company can no longer deliver what it promises, then perhaps it should just drop the service altogether.  In the past, I have paid yearly in advance for Prime (since it was $99/year), but have now switched to monthly Prime subscription because I want to be able to easily bail out if the service gets any worse.

When I told the Amazon rep this, she immediately issued a refund even though I purchased the product over a year ago.Since it was more that 90 since the purchase she said there would be a $7 restocking fee, which is reasonable. I said I did not want that and would keep trying to get the product manufacturer to respond. She then issued a $7 credit to use on my next order.Amazon support has always been great!","February 17, 2023"

I came to regret my decision when 15 days later I finally gave up on getting the printer to connect and stay connected to my network.I brought it back to Staples neatly packaged in the original Box. It was then that they told me that they only give you 14 days to return a printer. Literally it was the 15th day!! On the same day, almost as a lark, I brought back to Whole Foods a return that I had started 60 days earlier on Amazon. I went to the counter, no packaging, and said I might be too late to make this return. She scanned the QR Code and she said, we'll take care of it. And I went home and got my money.

Trying to get refund for double payments if they occurred.,"I’m a happy Amazon UK customer ( as I live in the UK). However a few years ago I accessed Amazon.com whilst in Houston.   Today I’ve received an email saying my .Com subscription is up for renewal and to update my payment details. I was surprised, as I’ve only just resubscribed to Amazon UK (£95).  I contacted customer service on my laptop ( can’t access on iPhone app).  The CS assistant was very helpful and cancelled future US subscriptions. I asked if she could go back on my account and see if other automatic payments I may have missed had gone through. She could not and referred me to raise it with my bank. I asked if I could see my payment history on Amazon.com page and told yes.   Looking at my history it doesn’t show any annual subscriptions.  So, either subs were not previously taken or subs were and I’m unable to see them.   If no subs previously taken by Amazon.com why the email to update my payment details?  I asked for an email to escalate my query to to be told not possible. How can a company as huge as Amazon have no way to escalate concerns/complaints?  This is not great customer service. If Amazon read this please get in contact. You must have .com payment history. As I said I’m a happy UK customer. Use Amazon a lot.  I don’t think it unreasonable to ask about past subscription payments and enquire about a refund for double payments.","February 04, 2023"

Five stars any day. The problem is with Amazon resellers. Amazon does not manage their resellers well. And the resellers will do everything they can to hide the fact that they are resellers. Exorbitant restocking fees are never mentioned, even though the product description says it is qualified for returns. Amazon should be mandating that resellers clearly state any limitations on the return of their products so that buyers can make an informed decision.

I had seen an item I wanted on sale recently, but I missed the sale. As a result, I was watching closely to catch it on sale again. This morning I saw that it was on sale again at the price I was willing to pay. I clicked on ""add to cart"" and went to check out. Sometime between when I found the sale price and when I went to check out, the price had increased by more than 20%. When I contacted customer service about this, their response was basically ""tough luck, you missed the sale"". After I gave up on getting it from Amazon at that price, I Googled the item to see if I could find it cheaper elsewhere. Right at the top of the results was an ad for Amazon with the item listed at the price I wanted, but when I clicked on it the price on their site was still the higher price. When I contacted their customer service again to point this out, there response was that they don't honor any price advertised anywhere else besides our site. I thought they had some input on the prices advertised on Google. I'm sure they pay Google for higher rankings in the search result, so to me it seems like false advertising.","January 24, 2023"

This is why Amazon is notorious for selling counterfeit products. But, with the global economy contracting and Amazon's sales with it, the company's management has shifted its focus to prioritize its customers. For example, Amazon has implemented many reforms designed to eliminate counterfeit products from its website. In addition, customer reviews on the Amazon site for food products provide many examples of the company selling outdated and stale products. Amazon is also addressing this issue, with a new focus on delivering food products in an acceptable condition. In fact, I order canned foods by the case from Amazon because they arrive in pristine condition. In stark contrast, their largest competitor refuses to sell canned foods by the case and instead ships severely damaged cans to its customers.

However I’ve noticed in the last 3 to 4 months a decline in the quality of their chat customer service agents as-well as being hit and miss on getting refunds for returns on occasions. I’ve had agents being quite slow at replying and sometimes quite blunt to me. They seem to have lost their politeness and willingness to help. I was recharged today for an order I returned about 5 months ago. The agent gave me two totally different reasons for this recharge and then cut me off the chat…. I’ve never seen their customer service like this and it appears to be a continuous trend. I hope their delivery drivers are not affected as they are very good.","January 14, 2023"

Some supplied directly by Amazon, some by suppliers. But just as Amazon as a company.Your delivery drivers always come on the day they say they will. I appreciate that alot. I also appreciate the fact that when one of your drivers cannot find my house that they contact me and make sure they do. Sometimes your drivers leave a parcel on my doorstep when I'm not in and there are lots of hiding places here. So it would be better if they hid it and sent a picture like DPD. Sometimes they do move them out of view. But compared to Evri - you are winning. Your drivers deliver and I appreciate that now. In fact I'd say I took delivery drivers delivering for granted. Not anymore.Also- the couple of times I have had big problems, your employees have sorted it.1. Being charged tax on an expensive item that did not advertise there would be tax on the listing coming from abroad (they said all tax was included). You fixed it and the bill was sorted.2. My child spent over £1000 on game tokens when he got hold of my device and your refunded me. It took a while and a couple of attempts to sort out, but you did it.3. I had signed up accidentally to a prime feature without realising. You saw I hadn't used it and refunded me in whole. No problem.I appreciate the fact that when things went wrong that weren't even your fault, that you fixed them for me. Thanks.","January 01, 2023"

Amazon always delivers on the day stated, usually next day, their drivers are competent and rarely cock up, if they do i have ALWAYS been instantly refunded so i can reorder. I can always speak to a personable and competent advisor and the prices on the site are usually cheaper than anywhere else. The £80 approx yearly charge for Prime is worth its weight in gold as it includes top Films and programmes online, free postage however big the delivery.

The inexpensive EXO Cinemaster II sounded like a great deal, but CAREFULLY reading Amazon reviews, I concluded it was a well-marketed drone, but NOT a great drone. The DJI Mini had many more reviews, almost all positive, so at spme extra expense I went with the DJI.

Customer support is ace and top notch, packaging and delivery or collection options set this company apart. I just wish more lockers available as sometimes collection is not an option for some products, Amazon has a buyer protection which is amazing and one of the best returns processes sometimes free, I would check as some market place platforms have free collections by Royal Mail from home. I honestly do not know what all the complaints are about because Amazon is the best thing and ebay since sliced bread for me. When you can not source stuff locally or even find better stuff cheaper online with logistics to die for lives me baffled how people are not able to engage with something so simple. Never been ripped off from Amazon, it is basically like a world wide market place, with buyer seller protection and some of the nest logistics option often for free with things like Amazon prime if you shop regularly. Thise reviews must be from people who do not know how to use a computer or a market place. I recall ordering from Amazon some Bruce Lee books when Amazon was the best place or a place to get books if you do not want to troll the internet or shop for locally with the convenience of best delivery options money can buy; I especially love the lockers and collection point options. Please please keep Amazon free of scammers and dodge people because that is what the internet is turning into with the online market place and electronic scammer scum bags out there and a den of bell ends. Literally if you have a product and would like to want to reach more markets or as it were all the markets Amazon is the place to sell as you can get stuff on here you simply could not else where from across the world with dirt cheap delivery always properly packed! I often feel like an inventor when searching for stuff as my mind will think of something I might need that will not probably be in the shops 60% of the time and you will 90% find what weird and wonderful wacky things you need on there whatever it is like everything for bicycles Amazon has it all, apart from maybe fast food delivery platforms haha they will probably end up doing that soon.

More times than not when I select a product it will give an estimate of 1-2 days on shipping, but once I pay for the item and it gets shipped, the shipping time changes from 5-8 days. Shipping has become unreliable, and the delivery people do not follow deliver instructions at all. I even have video recordings from my doorbell cam of them making rude comments when dropping my packages. It is almost pointless to pay for Prime for the purposes of faster shipping.","December 29, 2022"

However, I am now having to delete my entire account and all my connected accounts (Amazon Music Unlimited) simply to delete my archived order history.  This is a major shortcoming of Amazon services and a double standard compared to the ability to delete browsing history.  This is more than an inconvenience as I will now have to re-create my entire account along with my Prime Video and Amazon Music playlists (hundreds of songs).  This will take considerable time and effort and is a major inconvenience to accomplish what should be a simple option available to account holders.  It also is a deterrent to customers when ordering certain items if they will become a permanent record on their account without the option to delete if desired.

They take your money but don't deliver when the item is released. In my case it was a book. I contacted their customer support but the kind person could only tell me that the book in question was not in stock. On Amazon US it is in stock though, yes I bought from another Amazon domain. I would think that pre-orders are collected and when Amazon is able to order the book at the factory, they would order the amount of pre-orders and some extra copies. It looks like that is not the case. In fact, Amazon can not give exact dates to when the item would be in stock. So, it could be possible a pre-order itme will never arrive, but the money is gone. Bad service which impact the reliability of Amazon. I am not sure if I want to pre-order ever again from them. Only thing is, If I want the book in question a.s.a.p. I have to cancel my pre-order and order again for a price 2,5 times higher then before with a reseller on Amazon, not Amazon self. Amazing that Amazon is operating this way.

I ordered an item on December 7th and the delivery date it gave me was December 12th and that was fine. I go on the app today and looked to see why I hadn’t received an order confirmation email it shows the order was placed and is being prepared, I guess we have to confirm orders ourselves now by looking online. Now the delivery date has changed to December 16th, so they have added 4 days to the delivery date. Out of curiosity I clicked on the item as if I were going to order it and if I order within the next 7 hours and 36 minutes I will have it by December 13th (also that is only 1 day later than the original order delivery date I was given 2 days ago) So I order it 2 days after original order was placed and get it 3 days quicker. I’m tempted to cancel the first order and reorder to have it delivered sooner. My Prime membership is up at the end of this month and I am parting ways with them. I hope by some miracle that enough people will get fed up with with the way they do things lately.","December 07, 2022"

As a Prime member I am expecting fast delivery times but I am very lucky if I get a parcel in 5 days let alone the advertised 2 days. But my main complaint is the FREE returns which it seems no longer applies even though its stated on most items pages. It now transpires that on a large number of items Amazon has recently instigated a $7.99 pick up fee when requesting a pick up via UPS, or you can drive to the local drop off point which for me would cost around $12 in gas. This happened to me recently on items that arrive inoperable or damaged and despite assurances from a customer service person that it does not apply to faulty items I am still being charged!You will also notice a huge increase in sponsored items as you search Amazon. It used to be infrequently you would see a few sponsored items on a page but now some pages have more than 50% . Amazon seems to have found another way to make Jeff even more $$.Fake reviews have always been an issue recently commanding the attention of news outlets like CNN. In Amazons efforts to curtail these paid for reviews they are now blocking or banning genuine reviews. When they block a review you get a message that states: Amazon is not accepting reviews for this item from this e-mail address... I enjoy giving great reviews for great products and probably have many hundreds of 4 or 5 star reviews and hope that it helps customers feel safe about buying certain products. But recently I received a  message saying my 5 star review on a certain product will not be accepted. I e-mailed the address given in the reply 3 times  as to why the review was not acceptable, no answer. Why add an e-mail address to request a reason for the decline when you are not going to answer? So I have now stopped reviews altogether. I hope that Amazon changes some of it's policies but in the meantime I am purchasing more and more from ZORO who have a faster delivery service than Amazon and no prime monthly or annual fees..","June 12, 2022"

Being that card transactions are not ACH, they never take more than 24 hours to attempt the charge... Unless I buy from Amazon. Amazon charges you once the shipping process has started, NOT when you place the order, meaning it can take several days to charge you after you place the order. This has been frustrating for me because I'll place an order, not be charged for days, then get an email that the order is delayed for card declining, then rerun the card, wait MORE days and have more delays just for the issue to repeat itself. This feature is an issue for me, but it's not the end of the world.I started a support chat to see if there was a setting I could change to be charged at the time of the order (or within a reasonable 24 hours of the order being placed) but the rep ""Marie Dee"" that I talked to just danced around my question, not giving me a solid yes or no and being very cold, and when I repeated my question that she hadn't answered she just left the chat. It literally says in the chat transcript that she left the chat. I didn't curse, I didn't attack her or even the company, I was just pursuing an answer for what I thought was a pretty straightforward question and I guess she was frustrated that I wasn't accepting the canned macro script she was feeding me.I'm leaving a 2 star instead of 1 because I started up another chat immediately after with ""Himanshu"", who was kind and actually offered me a workaround. I can't change the charging time (time of order vs. time of shipping process beginning) if I use my debit card, BUT if I put the needed balance for the order on an Amazon gift card instead and use that for the purchase, I can avoid all the previous issues I've had and not worry about maintaining my checking balance for a charge that could come at any time.","December 01, 2022"

This also makes me concerned of the validity of customer reviews and how they're filtered though.I also spent a while seeing if I could reach customer support without either calling, or being in active conversation with them and no luck.

They ignored me for whole 7 days. I also did contact the manufacturer but Amazon still didn't really feel the pressure. So I decided to annoy again and again and again and again until I had another idea. Let's just directly mail Andy Jassy the ceo of Amazon which I did next. I did mention that in the customer support chat and 10 seconds later I got reconnected to someone from problem prevention or something like that and then I explained to them everything again and then 15 min later I'm not even joking they organized a replacement order just like that. Finally!!!!!? But I have really mixed feelings about all the hassle you have to go through first until you mention Andy Jassy and suddenly everything goes really fast.

At 2:15 approx I checked for updates on app and info stated will be delivered between 15:00-18:00 . I returned home 14:50 and the item was delivered at 17:50 approx, I was so excited I opened the package straight away to find fire HD 10 kids proAGES 6+.

I got myself so worked-up during and after speaking to customer service officer I just could not believe someone could have done this cruel act. I became unwell my blood pressure hit the roof. I urgently needed the iPad and the only one similar left online was over £100 more. I then contacted customer service again via online chat and ask due to the distress it caused me and I really need the the iPad with those specs for traveling,  if they could help with a discount to purchase the other one I was refused and told Amazon does not do price match or offer compensation. I was refused a manager when asked and the person I was speaking to ended the chat without telling me so I was chatting to myself for a while before I realised.

However, my son does have 'Prime' and on this occasion I did need something quickly. He ordered it in the evening and it was here by 11am the following day.I think the very low overall score might relate to a few annoying issues, like the 'Prime' membership.

Contacted Amazon explained how I was anxiously waiting they said they will refund me and if I wanted the product to reorder it again. So I did, but all I wanted them to do was to contact their depot so that they can contact the carrier and confirm for a guaranteed delivery. I was told by Amazon customer service they can't do that after chatting to fifth person. By this time I had lost it with them. How is that someone like Amazon can't provide you further service about your product where it has gone!!! Disgusting service proper shamble. Is it is too much to ask for to chase up my order apart from what their screen says?? I said who do I speak to about complaints? I was told there is no complaints department.I still can't come over this. People who work in the background in Amazon need some serious attitude training. Luckily I have not had major issues with them in the past, but this time it was a complete let down.All I wanted to know that my product which I reordered is defo going to get to me this time and not get lost in transition!!!

This was a birthday gift for 9/22. My son helped me drive his birthday gift to an Amazon locker for return. The seller sent an old version at the new version price. And, last week, Amazon Warehouse delivered a microwave upside down with broken foam that was hugely dented inside and out for a small markdown. It looks like trash and cost $300 with tax. Now, I have to repackage this heavy item and bring it to UPS and go without a microwave, or reorder through Amazon (rewarding incompetence). Amazon has good infrastructure (fast delivery, return lockers at third parity locations). It undoubtedly has greased some palms.

I have lived on the streets of Las Vegas for nearly 3 years now.  And the only way I can order items online and have them delivered to me is through Amazon Hub Yellow Box.  I have only purchased a very few products from Amazon over the past 3 years.  Being unemployed, and homeless, I have been habitually short on money since the Covid-19 lockdowns began.This past month, I had the opportunity to purchase a few more items from Amazon.  And I had those items sent to the ""Berkeley Square"" Yellow Box, at the Amazon Hub Locker on E. Owens, in N Las Vegas, NV.  There I met the best customer service associate that I have ever had the pleasure of meeting - Ms. Shy Lauri.There were several items in my order that I had to return.  And two of those items presented problems with the Amazon refunds.  I had to go back to the Amazon Hub Locker several times, in order to troubleshoot the refund status of these items.  And each time Shy Lauri was prompt, cordial, and professional.  She took no notice of my homelessness and somewhat shabby appearance.  And she treated me with kindness and respect at every visit.She even offered me cold bottled water, each and every time.  And in Las Vegas' 110+ degree weather, that cold water was nothing short of life saving.Eventually, she help me figure out what needed to be done to receive my refunds.  And, at the same time, she helped me maintain my faith in ordering from Amazon.I am 55 years old, and I have never met such an agreeable, professional, genuinely concerned and caring employee and person.  Amazon should be proud of have Shy Lauri as an employee.  She has represented the company impeccable well.  And, in the future, I will continue to use that Amazon Hub Locker location for all my delivery needs.  Whether I am homeless, or living in a house.Shy Lauri has not only restored my faith in Amazon, she has also restored my faith in the youth of this new generation.Thank you, Shy.","September 07, 2022"

For years I have battled with symptoms and flare-ups that I was unsure how to handle and left with some misguided medical information. Although I am still learning, the recipes included within this book have improved my day-to-day life significantly by making only minor changes. What I was looking for the most with this recipe book were some simple meal ideas that I could prepare ahead of time and easily take to work for lunch. Meal planning can be overwhelming, but this guide has a 21-day meal plan that is easily repetitive and enjoyable, while also including some meals that are easy to prepare in advance.

I hate myself for giving in but I have several orders in the works and several tv series I am invested in and I am just too tired to keep trying to find out how to downgrade to Prime Video. It took 3 agents before I even found one who knew there was a Prime Video membership. First   2 keep giving me info on how to rent or purchase movies. As long as I have been using Prime I think I am well versed in how to do that. Only thing I learned new and of use is that you can pause your Prime membership. Of course no details on for how long but will cross that bridge when I need it. For now Amazon you need to do better. How can your customer service people not know you also offer a Prime Video membership?? This is last price increase I am going to tolerate for the immediate future as this has now been $40 in two years, Especially if you continue to selectively grant discounts. How about eliminating the selective discounts and reduce your rate for all? Barring that my first choice of who should get a discount is definitely our veterans. They deserve every and any discount available IMHO. I am wore out trying to deal with this so have to bow my head in defeat. Next year will not be the same. Count on it. Note to other seniors out there also angry over the picking and choosing of discounts know that you can still get free shipping with an order of at least $25. They will blah, blah you about the 2 day shipping you get with Prime but the timeframe has gone downhill drastically. Yesterday was first 2 day shipping I have got in many, many months. You do not get 2 days shipping on everything which is a common misunderstanding by many. It is a selective list that Amazon determines. Others may have better luck but the things I order are rarely on that selective list. Most shipments are averaging 4-5 days, some even longer. If you can accept a longer shipping time and only other option you really use is video then check into the Prime Video membership. At this time it is $8.99 a month. I don't use the Kindle, music or any other Prime options so that will do me fine next year.","August 22, 2022"

As a result, all reviews submitted by this account have been removed and this account will no longer be able to contribute reviews and other content on Amazon.  If you would like to learn more, please see our community guidelines.”It’s interesting that with ever purchase we are asked to submit a review. I am new to TrustPilot and wondered if Amazon used them for their reviews. I’m guessing they do not. After years of buying products from Amazon and writing to occasional review, the above quoted statement is what I get if I try to write a review. It’s been a while since I called their customer service about this because, honestly, I’ve given up. On the phone they are most helpful and say that they “can fix that!” Well, nope. Apparently, their computer has determined we are in cahoots with the vendors. A look at the purchase history would show us to be in cahoots with all of them it that’s the case!Sometimes potential customers need to know that the part actually fits “a 1997 Dodge” even though Amazon’s computer said it doesn’t. Sometimes negative reviews have no basis. I attribute a lot of them to, what I call, 3-percenters. They would be negative if you gave them the item. Why do I still give them a 5-star rating? If I do buy a product that I need to return, the process is simple. The return window is plenty long so I can determine if the item works for me. Also, they have a vast selection at any price you want to pay. I’ve never read a positive review that I didn’t agree with after buying and using that product. Would I buy an item having a preponderance of negative or critical reviews? Probably not, but I have and been perfectly happy with my decision. Moving on, Amazon has invested heavily in their business. Because of their distribution network it is rare that it takes more than 3 days to receive an item. Often it’s less than 2! Yes, I like to buy locally, but when they don’t have the item in stock and it will be “a week to 10 days” for delivery…with a higher price, to boot…I’m sorry, I’m going with Amazon. In my opinion, there is no online seller that can compete with them except for maybe WalMart, though their vendors often add exorbitant shipping fees. So, back to why I wrote this, my only complaint with Amazon is not being able to write reviews.","July 28, 2022"

I have never received much help from Customer service with Amazon Prime. I've asked why do they keep saying they will provide next day service when they do not. I'm still waiting on an answer.

I received my cat food, the wall mount for echo dot, my cup covers and a lightbulb for the echo dot.

The total cost of the item was approx. $500.   I have returned purchases to Amazon many times and the returned funds have always posted against my Amazon credit card balance.  This time the credit posted to a non-existent Amazon gift card.  When returning the item, Amazon preselected “refund to your Amazon account balance”.  This in no way indicates it is returning the money to a non-existent gift card.  To add insult to injury purchases were posted against the gift card vs my Amazon credit card so they won’t refund the remaining gift card balance to my Amazon credit card!!  This seems to be entrapment, as Amazon’s messaging regarding where the funds are being returned to isn’t clear!  It seems Amazon is intentionally using vague language in their auto pre-selected option for returned funds to ensure customers spend the returned money through their company!  If this is unintentional, Amazon should add “gift card” to the auto pre-selected return funds option so customers understand the funds will not be returned to their Amazon credit card used to make the purchase, but instead be added to a non-existent gift card balance.  The gift card was created at the time of the refund!  As I stated above, this seems like financial entrapment to ensure returned funds remain with AMAZON vs being credited to the Amazon credit card used to make the purchase! I believe any reasonable person would assume “be returned to Amazon account balance” means being returned to your Amazon credit card balance.  Especially since at the time of the return there were no other Amazon account balances other than the credit card, there weren’t any gift cards on file, and every other refund processed through Amazon had been credited to my Amazon credit card balance. When “gift card” isn’t in the sentence of the pre-selected option, and Amazon has credit card options, it seems like it is an intentional action by Amazon to be vague in their messaging to entrap customer’s funds and ensure more funds are expended through Amazon!  I rarely write reviews, but felt people should know about Amazon’s ridiculous refund policy/messaging, as it could really cause harm to families already in financial distress due to the resent pandemic and resulting economic downturn.","June 11, 2022"

Tried leaving this information as part of my Amazon reviews but, of course. Amazon won't let that be published. Will be letting my Prime membership end in December (paid through then). Have actually been finding items cheaper locally than on Amazon, while also helping my local economy. Will be using an alternative for online purchases (Walmart, ebay, Wayfair, etc.).

In looking back at the hundreds of orders that I placed, I have to give Amazon credit for the getting most of the merchandise safely to our 50th state, Hawaii. The N95 and KN95 masks were critical to the health of my family. Numerous tools were also delivered in a functional state, which was a big plus since most of us were fixing up our homes during the crisis. Although not a tool warehouse, like Home Depot, Amazon does carry high quality tools from Japan, Taiwan and Europe. Most are not even sold by Home Depot or Lowes. The reviews on Amazon are more extensive than elsewhere. This helps buyers narrow down which items to order. Only around 1% of all orders turn out to be turkeys. The defects on a set of NAS drives were not due to the manufacturer. They were caused by bad packaging. Nothing but a cheap paper envelope was used, with no padding material. I should have looked more carefully at the history of the affiliate merchant in NYC, who fulfilled the order. Resolving this problem with a service associate took time, and tied up money for nearly 3 weeks.","May 08, 2022"

They promise 1-day or 2-day deliveries and 7 out of 10 times they are never delivered in the promised time frame. What they do not tell you is that they have a clause that is not clearly posted anywhere for you to easily say. It says that the delivery time begins when the item is actually shipped. So, if you order an item on a Saturday and it says it will be delivered on Monday by 10 p.m. this estimate will only be accurate if the item was picked up by the carrier on Saturday. Now shipping delays happen and often they do happen as a result of the carrier so that is completely out of Amazon's hands but change the system to more accurately reflect these delays.Quit making promises that you knowingly cannot keep. Additionally, if an item is not able to be delivered because it is damaged in the transit process then include that reason in the email when you cancel the order. This actually just happened to me. In fact, it is the second time in a month that I ordered an item that I never got.Previously I ordered an item that the third-party vendor said was in stock but were unable to fulfill the order because they banked on the parts being in stock when they were going to be shipped. This didn't happen and they simply refunded my money with no explanation as to why.In both cases I had to call the vendor and Amazon to get details on why. Amazon needs to hold themselves and their vendors accountable for the accuracy of their descriptions. From shipping lead times to availability of items.While ordering online is convenient and often times less expensive it is beginning to show the weaknesses that are apparent. At least when you go to a brick-and-mortar store you know whether they have the item and if not, you move on to find it elsewhere.  There is no expectation that you are being told it is in stock when it really isn't. Their inventory is what it is. We are using online services such as Amazon with the expectation that they are going to be upfront with regards to inventory levels and shipping estimates. Not to be told that there are 15 items in stock, or it is a 2-day delivery and then not be able to fulfill these promises more often than not. Quit trying to look spectacular only to look lackluster most of the time. Prices are not everything when you cannot get the items anyways. I gave Amazon 2 stars only because of pricing. However, if the issues continue my 15-year history with them is gone. I will gladly pay more and be part of their solution to the problem by seeing them go the way of K-Mart and Sears.","May 04, 2022"

I have been searching for a great pillow for over 25 years. This pillow is awesome it is not as large as the standard queen size pillows but it is the perfect size for me. I don’t need a large pillow because I don’t have a large head. One of the main reasons I bought this pillow is because of the video showing the stuffing that is inside it. The pillow came with plenty of stuffing. I took some out and adjusted it to my liking. The quality of this pillow is excellent I’m very satisfied with it and I am a picky person. I am also wanting to purchase some more pillowcases. I see that they come in a lot of different Colors. These pillows are made in England Not China. The quality is fantastic.

So today 3/6/22 is the first day that Amazon’s employee lied. I had a package that was suppose to be delivered today and it gave the estimated time frame. For me to get a notification stating that it was delivered and I received nothing is confusing. Then I go to the Amazon app and it says that they handed to the resident (ME). So now I’m really confused because how did you hand it to me and I’m not home. Nobody is home and I have a ring camera and I have no footage of anyone delivering anything. So now I’m very very skeptical of ordering anything from this company again. If you have workers lying saying they delivered it and they handed it to the purchaser and didn’t that’s very bad business. Like where in the heck is my package? Amazon this is the last time you’re gonna get my money.,"March 07, 2022"

Amazon has the same products as supermarkets for much cheaper prices. And unlike royal mail or hermes in the uk their delivery is 95% of the time on or before the delivery date. Packages are very rarely lost and customer service are always very helpful and will give you coupons if they can't fix your issue. They're the only online business that are actually trustworthy and won't try to screw you. Only very minor issue i have with them is when a delivery date changes and they don't notify you or ask if you'd like to cancel/ refund. They don't even tell you it changed if you check which can make you doubt yourself. Again this is very rare to happen and they are generally excellent.,"February 24, 2022"

I've been a customer since 2005 so I have plenty of experience of dealing with them. Before this year, I never had any particular issue - of course, occasionally things were delayed, but the tracking on their website or external couriers tells you  the expected due date, so there are no surprises. The goods have been as described, with rarely the odd error which was corrected when they were notified.The reason I'm posting now is because this Christmas (2021) several things went wrong; two packages weren't delivered - they got stuck at customs and never reappeared - and three things I bought all broke (a phone, a smartwatch and a belt for bad backs). All were ordered from abroad, so returning the items was a little more complicated than usual and involved arguing in the local village post office, who had no idea what to do with the labels and forms. However, Amazon themselves couldn't have been more helpful. In one case they changed the return label for a different courier because DHL wouldn't collect the package (that's another story, 'computer says no'). I had to phone Amazon three times to sort things out, and they did everything to make it as painless as possible.Whether a large corporation should survive by gobbling up the opposition is another question...but Amazon are, in my experience, reliable and generally cheaper. That's why I'm still using them after all this time.","January 21, 2022"

Items are rarely delayed, delivery is usually within the time frame given and customer service is often responsive. They are quick to rectify mistakes and mostly provide refunds when understandably requested.I did, however, receive a rather odd email from Amazon questioning my number of returns, which I challenged and just received a generic response- hence the one start deducted. This was not gratefully received. As a customer, I make a lot of Amazon purchases and, thus, a number of returns in my attempts to find the best product.","January 20, 2022"

However, I have issues with delivery. My experience with the delivery is bad. I noticed that I am not the only one who has issues with delivery in my apartment. Some of the residents in the apartment have experienced the same issue. When Item is delivered, they update amazon where the package is left. Therefore, it is delivered with misinformation about the exact location of the package because the package actually was placed outside of the apartment where an individual somehow stole my package. I could not confirm whether it is a false delivery or the package is actually stolen... I had to report it and I requested a refund. Amazon is very hesitant about refunding or replacement. Nowadays, I can not trust amazon with delivery. I start to feel anxious that they will misinform me about where my package was actually placed.","January 18, 2022"

IT'S A DRAW WHEN IT COMES TO THIS COMPANY & GETTING A GNOWLEDABLE HUMAN ON THE PHONE TO ATTEND ISSUES.FORTUNATELY, IT WAS THE LUCK OF THE DRAW FOR ME THIS MOST RECENT PURCHASE. It was a SIMPLE 2 ITEMS. AFTER A GOOGLE SEARCH OF COURSE AMAZON CAME UP. ONE OF THE MOST REASONABLY PRICED VERSION of what needed so I clicked into the account since They forces me to purchase as a member and gnot simply a visitor. The shipping was $1& change away from being free so I found an additional item that I was going to other wise look for at my local Dollar Tree and added it. Recieved the Free shipping and literally paid less than $1 for my order in total. Now You may wonder how it was possible? After having had so many issues concerning my original order that was placed in December, I had Credits in that account that I wasn't even concerned to use since it was such a frustrating and convoluted process to get the order and all the back and forth involved in that process. Out of about 50+ Reps I had a positive about 6% of those WHO we're efficient. 2 out of them were prompt enough to supplement my troubles over the more than 8 days regarding that process. Thankfully Needles to say I wasn't happy but was given a satisfying partial credit. This allowed me to only end up paying less than $1 for my second order. Don't wish to be a reoccurring customer with Amazon. Though I'm satisfied with my purchases the stress of it and the level of customer service as a majority isn't something I'm looking forward to experiencing in the future.

I order from them all the time, especially the last few years because it is easier than having to go out and search our local stores for particular items, that often times are not in stock or simply not available where I live. I have also often searched for other online stores to purchase items from but rarely do I find one where I can get free shipping and a lower price. So, though it pains me to do so, if I need to place an order for certain items, I shop on Amazon. That being said, the customer service I personally have received has been pretty awesome, the majority of the time. The key is NOT to buy from a third party seller, as that is a huge headache, in my own experience. Also, you cannot write a review that directly complains about Amazon because they will not ""approve"" it. Which is ridiculous because we all know that Amazon has gone way downhill since the early days. However, that being said, it is possible to get a refund, make a return, and get your money back if you NEVER receive your package. It is a bit of a pain in the a** but it can be done be done. What it takes is patience, persistence, and knowing how to navigate the system. I recently was given a large gift card credit to spend simply because I had such an issue with shipping and it was days past the time my package should have arrived with an item that was an 1/8 of the price of the credit I was given. I used a gift card to purchase it, so I was happy with that. I am the person who manages to get my refunds AND I often get my items for free because I do NOT take NO for an answer. I am polite (for the most part), kind, calm and I do NOT give up. I have experienced many problems with shipping, missing items, items delivered to the wrong apartment, poorly made items, poorly packaged items, products not arriving on time,etc.etc. And each time, customer service has taken care of me. Sometimes it takes more than one phone call and asking for a supervisor, explaining the situation over and over again, but in the end the result is in my favor. I actually fill out the survey the customer service agents email me after the phone call. I am honest and thorough when I fill them out and I praise those exceptional agents who go the extra mile for me, as I appreciate excellent service, as I have been in there shoes in the past. However, if I can find an alternative to shopping at Amazon that also offers free shipping and lower prices, I take it. I would love nothing more than to not have to order another item from them. Obviously, the company treats their employees like crap, the quality of many of their products is merde, they often price gouge, many of their reviews are bogus, the packages are usually not packaged properly or poorly packaged, returns have become a huge pain, many third party sellers rip people off, it can take longer to receive refunds and reviews have to be approved(utter.bullsh**.) Jeff Bezos is making money hand over first, while not paying the amount of taxes or any at all on the billions of dollars he has made and not caring one iota about his employees or his customers. This is what happens when we end up with monopolies and extremely few options available to us. My goal this year is to buy less, continue to search for other online businesses to shop from (especially local ones) and continue to vote, sign petitions and work towards changing the current status quo.","January 07, 2022"

Yet the delivery information stated that the package was delivered!  Yes.  But at the wrong address.  There's no help from Amazon.com if one's package is missing although status claims it was delivered.  I had to do an online automated chat via Amazon.com to help resolve the issue.  However, all this chat does is give a few choices as to what one's issue is.  In my case, I chose 'missing package', the online chat said to wait as delivery status could be updated incorrectly and package may be delivered in 24 hours. Later on the same evening, I received an an auto email message from Amazon.com stating that the item would be delivered by 10pm that evening. Well, the package was delivered but at 6pm that night by my neighbor.  Our security camera confirmed that fact.  Thankfully our neighbor was kind enough to walk the package to our house.  If they were not honest and decided to either keep or dump my package I'd be the loser.  No more Amazon email updates or anything else to resolve the issue either so what they claimed (i.e. that the delivery might happen in 24 hours time) was all a lie.Therefore, one is out of luck if the driver carelessly delivers one's package to a different address!

Amazon is dependant (often) on 3rd party sellers and at the mercy of USPS, UPS, and FedEx and SO many people do not take this into account when ranking them.Now, this is not to say that Amazon hasn't ""slowed"" on how they do things. Yes, ""some"" of their Amazon bases don't know what ""efficient"" means when it comes to processing and shipping because they don't have the staff to support the demand (read that again because that fact is KEY) and their 3-5 day guarantee goes out the door REALLY quick. In point of fact, that little idealism just needs to be removed because it makes them look worse than bad.Has Amazon ever ""screwed"" me on and order. NO and they never will. Why? A lot of people don't handle their situation with research and evidence, I make it a point to do that. I check tracking, i talk to my UPS and USPS mail people, i contact possibly 3rd party sellers to find out what's going on before i even ""think"" of contacting Amazon.Once you have all the possible facts and (again this is KEY so re-read it) you have a ""solid"" history with them, they will ALWAYS go out of their way to take care of you IF you get a good associate to talk to.Lately, i've been ""flushed"" by some online chat associates so CALL rather than chat because it's harder for them to make up some excuse about ""disconnections"" when SOME of these associates (3rd party and out-sourced, you KNOW when you get a good associate vs a out-sourced one) just don't want to handle you.If you come to Amazon ""calm"" and in possession with as many facts (out of your own investigation) as possible they will work with you and, often, they will drop you some credit to your account for your inconvenience.Now this is not saying that there are no bad associates. Yes, there are so i could do without myself by they are FEW and far between unless you get some of these outside of your own country trying to work situations inside your own country.IF YOU GET A BAD ASSOCIATE then TRY AGAIN and call or chat to get a better one. Don't be LAZY about it, try harder. Take a breath and get your anger out of your system.If you try you WILL get satisfaction with Amazon if you have a ""solid"" history with them. However, if you are known to have called in several issues without the facts, they won't try so hard because they just know you're a pain and don't want to deal with you.Now, let me clarify this: I have returned hundreds of items but i've been with them since the beginning and they know me and there are ""notes"" on me that says, ""He investigates, don't try and BS him"" because i've talked voice with a few and they've told me there are notes on me. They know i go the distance when it comes to facts so they know THEY have to go the distance as well.If you are expecting to call in and get butt kissers then you are the problem. They are not there to apologize and beg for forgiveness. They are there to follow facts/data and try to fix the issue to the best of their somewhat limited power (it goes in levels and the end-level phone associate might not have the ability to get what you need) so DONT GET HOSTILE for no reason.","November 24, 2021"

I will be closing my card with them as well. I'll purchase through my daughter if she keeps prime, but after this last order, I don't even know if I'll use Amazon anymore.""Order this item in the next 2+ hours and get it tomorrow"" but they lied. I won't get it till the next day, if it's on time. It was needed today (the promised delivery date at time of order). I called looking for compensation, and all that was offered was cancellation of the order. So because of deceptive shipping promises that they can't control, I will simply cancel prime membership and my Amazon credit card. I feel confident they have enough competition now so I hope they get their act together soon to get back on top.**Update- I checked email after placing this review and the rep notified me she canceled my prime membership for me.

I’m getting fed up of them missing their delivery dates. And that can be sooner or later than stated. One example is when they promise 10PM same day & the item turns up the following day or even later. Another one is when you’re asked to choose the delivery date & it gets delivered the day before or day after when you’re not around. Another is “ Out for delivery: Now estimated 5:15 PM - 8:15 PM” which basically means ‘we’ve messed up & don’t know when you’ll get your order but it won’t be today!’ Delivery is an extremely important aspect of the whole transaction.  Irrespective of challenges due to COVID, Amazon really need to get their act together & sharpish!","October 18, 2021"

I bought items such as ram, facewash, sweatshirt, earplug, gaming controller that were not delivered at all. They are more hesitant to refund or replace an item.

The only problem about amazon is not themselves, but the other companies and traders who use the platform to sell their products, some are extremely overpriced, fake and scams.

Most times the good are good and received in a timely manner. Returns have generally been OK with the odd blip for some farawy country where there is a lot of sharp practice. Amazon do not protect you from this. That said Amazon has a lot of problems:1. A customer service team which is difficult to access and does not do it's job. Its investigations are superficial and they give glib stock answers and frequently don't take appropriate action even when they say they will. A recipe for real customer frustration and I am VERY frustrated with this service.2. I have noticed 8 recurring charges of 17.99 on my account. I have tried to get them to investigate it. I got a stock answer about why this could be happening. So they have not investigated it - otherwise they would have known what the charges were for. I will get my bank to investigate this now.I also have nearly 8 consecutive charges for Prime membership, despite the fact I had cancelled it. They don't always action your cancellation. Sometimes I have 2 Amazon Prime charges within a couple of days or a couple of weeks. Are they telling me I caused this. I will now get my bank to investigate this too.3. Amazon goods are not necessarily cheaper. In fact I have paid over the odds for many things, but I have only found out after purchase.I am now done with Amazon. I believe either its digital platform is faulty, hence the charges or they have dishonest staff who access my card. I won't know which until the investigation is complete.I believe it is worth taking time over what you buy and if I have to pay a little more I will. I believe the safest way to shop is go to the shops. Amazon created a buzz around internet shopping but I have seen its flaws and belueve I am now actually out of pocket financially.","October 12, 2021"

Since Covid hit I have spent THOUSANDS of dollars with them. Throughout the entire shutdown Amazon NEVER missed a delivery date. In the past several months it has gone SERIOUSLY DOWN HILL!! What is going on?? If you can not deliver an item on time then why do you even put a delivery day on the items? It's ridiculous. I pay for PRIME SERVICE but I am no longer getting it. Sorry, but I don't go for that crap. When I order a product and it specifically gives me a date of arrival BEFORE I ORDER IT!! I consider that a contract! I pay for the service, I pay for the item...but do not receive my order on the promised date. In May of 2021 I had a little incident where some supplies for a customers order got damaged. I immediately ordered what I needed with the ""promise"" of it being delivered the next day. Sometime around 5:00pm (long after it should have already been delivered) I received a text message informing me that it would not be arriving when promised. It was to arrive on May 21st which still would have given me 2 1/2 days to complete my customers order which was to be delivered on the evening of Monday, May 24th.   I did not receive my supplies until the afternoon of May 24th!! Needless to say I could not deliver as promised because Amazon did not deliver as promised. The loss of that order cost me $300.00!! When I called to complain, they had the AUDACITY to offer me a $5.00 credit to my account. ARE YOU KIDDING ME!!?? You cost me $300.00 and you want to compensate that with a $5.00 credit? Talk about a slap in the face. As a matter of fact that was and is THE ONLY time that Amazon had the courtesy of letting me know. Usually they do not even do that much. It's not until I see UPS drive past my house that I realize that something is wrong and then I have to check. They are also starting to get really cheap with their packaging. I have been ordering my makeup from Amazon for quite a while now. It used to come wrapped in bubble wrap in a box. There were no problems. Now they have been sending it in really thin and cheesy mail bags/envelopes and it arrives in pieces. One time they sent 2 glass bottle of foundation, 2 2 compacts of face powder and a tube of mascara all together in a paper shipping bag. Absolutely no padding, bubble wrap or anything!! Well after shipping and UPS throwing it around for a day and a half, I had a real mess on my hands. How much common sense does it actually take for someone to know that 2 glass bottles and some fragile makeup needs to be packed properly with padding and a box?? I see that Amazon sells Waterford Crystal and Austrian crystal wine glasses at $400.00 -$500.00 per half dozen. I can just imagine how they would arrive!! You NEED to get it together Amazon.

I purchased a jacket that stated it was 100% wool but it was mostly polyester. It was a pain because I had to go to the expense of packing and I almost had to pay for shipping.

However, since I became a Prime member, customer service and their delivery promises fail at every level. For the fourth time in two months, I have an order that will not be delivered as promised. It's due to arrive today, 9/13 @10:00pm. It's 4:05 and it hasn't even shipped yet. In the past, I have sent emails directly to Jeff Bezos in order to get resolution, but at this point I think things are beyond repair. The CSA's obviously read a scripted response and have little power to correct any given situation to the customer's satisfaction. And their typical response is to give the package a couple of days to arrive. Last time I had a problem Amazon refunded my Prime membership fees and kept my membership in place at no charge until renewal, saying, ""We hope to win back your trust"". Well...that didn't work out so well. Not sure how many more times I can give them to screw things up before I say ""Screw it"".","September 13, 2021"

However if you have a question about your account or website functionality, good luck talking to anybody.  Took an hour to figure out something as simple as receiving delivery notifications.  This is basic stuff.  Couldn't get through by phone (and they don't post their customer service number which I had to find elsewhere online) so I opened a chat window.  Looks like customer service is all outsourced to India.  The first person couldn't asnwer the question so she just dropped the chat.  The second person was able to set up notifications, but neglected to mention (until I asked) it's something THEY have to do.  Apparently Amazon customers can't set up their own delivery notifications which is rather absurd.  The information on Amazon in their ""help"" section is outdated and now incorrect.  Took  an hour just to figure out how to receive a text or email when a package is delivered. Just about every other company allows  customers to set up their own delivery alerts.  And now you have to jump through hoops just to log in because Amazon has had so many security breaches.  I'm doing myself and everybody else a favor by supporting smaller companies.  I don't care if it does take an extra couple of days to receive an order.  This last Amazon order was an exception.  I couldn't  find the product elsewhere.  Amazon used to be good.  Now it's verging on becoming a monstrous AI driven non-human entity.","September 10, 2021"

Between my wife and I am sure we're well into the hundreds of purchases, and I'd say 98% of them have been trouble-free.There was a problem last winter, I'd ordered a Futon that was supposed to be delivered by x-date. It didn't show, contacted customer service. They said they'd try to expedite it and they'd call me by x-time the next day to confirm it arrived.Well, they didn't call, so I did. Got apologies and was told it should be to me in two days, if it wasn't to call them and they'd initiate a refund.It didn't show, and I called, and they issued a refund. Three days later the futon showed up. Got a return authorization and label - but I got back with them and said I wasn't lugging it to UPS, that they should arrange a pickup, and they did with no problem.I think the issue with people's bad experience falls into two categories - not doing research on the items and the sellers, and the unfortunate choices Amazon makes about shipping. All my orders arrive either USPS or UPS.I do miss the two-day shipping, but I guess that's gone forever. So I have to plan ahead, and if it's urgent, all the stores are less than 20 minutes away.All that so say that in nearly two decades, I've never had any concerns about my Amazon purchases.","August 29, 2021"

Recently, i have notices a sharp decline in the service provided by Amazon, most notably, their inability to deliver items on time or even on the same day. I order a pair of headphones for next day delivery which were dispatched that day, then shipped in the early hours, the item was sent out for delivery and a slot for delivery was sent. This time came and went and a corporate apology e mail sent. Having waiting in all day, I had to go out and at 9pm, I received a call, stating a delivery was attempted but i was not in. Driver said he would deliver following day. Today, i have been informed that the item has been sent back to the local sorting office and a delay has been experienced in delivery and no one knows (or cares, as they have my money) why or when i will receive the item and this is on the Prime service.This is FAR FROM A PRIME SERVICE and is happening more often than not now. Not only to you pay your annual subscription, you also pay a PREMIUM PRICE for PREMIUM DELIVERY which doesn’t occur. I have attempted to speak with customer service who just read out and repeat the scant information from the tracking info. In reality, the delivery companies take on work beyond their abilities in their greedy pursuit of wealth and when things go wrong, they just brush the problem aside and carry on as if nothing has happened, they have no real strategy for dealing with balls ups. THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE and I shan’t be using Amazon anymore, there are better and more reliable options out there. This seems to be my only option now and i advise others to do the same and save their money! NOT RECOMMENDED!","August 27, 2021"

I have never once had any problem whatsoever. I've never had to return anything. All of my packages arrive earlier than expected. (Amazon prime is not always next day). The drivers are great! They either ring my doorbell or if they can get in the building they leave it inside. They're always very polite.

UPS refuses to take any fault for packages they lose or deliver to the wrong home, sometimes even in the completely wrong state or town which should be something easy to notice. But apparently as long as they delivered it, it shouldn't matter where and they shouldn't have to refund the product or replace it. It's absolutely disgusting business tactics and their affiliation with UPS Will only ruin their reputation as it continues. I RECOMMEND FINDING A SERVICE NEAR YOU OR ONLY ORDERING FROM CITES THAT USE FEDEX OR REGULAR POSTAL DELIVERY AND NOT UPS. Products 3 stars: pretty wide range of products you'll find anything you need. Its 50 50 on price it'll either cost more than your local store or less so it can be a bargain if used right. ALWAYS READ PRODUCT REVIEWS BEFORE PURCHASE. you'd be surprised what products actually pose the most issues but trust the most recent reviews and make your purchase accordingly. Sometimes the product is good but the means of delivery are awful. Prices 3 stars: all prices are basic standard prices not really any higher ir lower than local prices. You'll save as much as you would using coupons on a store basically. But if you dont like going out because your sick or other reasons, it is very useful to avoid social contact. Customer service 5 stars: these guys are not playing games. If you lose money, theyr losing money to. Take advantage of customer service and be patient! I have had wonderful results and always ended up getting a refund or a return with their help, all be it sometimes it's a long process so again, patience is key. But they will hunt people down for you no joke.","August 20, 2021"

I have ordered a variety of products, from dog shampoo to Pokemon products. There were a few instances where I ordered something that I ended up festering an allergic reaction to. Even though the listing said no returns, I was able to speak with Amazon customer service via CHAT (THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PART, SO READ CAREFULLY). I have had ZERO complaints about Amazon customer service. Why? I NEVER get angry at the rep. Doesn't matter if they are Indian or not. Be courteous and polite when conversing with the rep. Don't be a Karen. Do not ask for the manager cause you won't be getting one. The fate of your complaint pretty much rests in their hands. Act like a beech, you won't be provided any resolution whatsoever. You're talking to a stranger, so make sure you have some manners!!! They are not your child, so stop reprimanding them!When returning multiple products, MAKE SURE THAT YOU DIVIDE THEM OUT ACCORDING TO THEIR ORDERS!!!! Throwing in items from multiple orders into a box is actually wrong, I've learned this from an Amazon rep. Doing so will not only ensure that you will NOT get a timely refund, but it creates more work for the people in the Amazon returns department who then have to manually look through your entire order history and match them up. In a busy work environment nobody wants to have to do that. Another thing that people seem to be missing: when returning an item pack the items CAREFULLY. You can initiate a return for a defective/unwanted product, but if the Amazon workers open up your box and find that it is damaged, they will NO LONGER refund you, they have implemented this policy a few years back. So make sure you pack your items carefully. Don't just toss them in a box without any cushioning/padding and then call it a day. Another thing that I've seen too many Amazon shoppers do is that they FAIL to read reviews before purchasing. That item is 3 stars for a reason! Don't just buy it because it looks like it works/is authentic. Too often I'm seeing people write negative reviews for an already terrible product because they failed to read the reviews. The reviews are there for a reason, and should guide you in your purchase making. It's like buying the first car you see because you like the way it looks, then coming back to the dealership the next day because you discovered that you're too small/big to fit properly in the driver's seat. Be a SMART buyer, not a DUMB one. As a suggestion, Amazon needs to invest in a 'cooling warehouse' for perishable products such as skincare, which lose their efficacy by a large margin when exposed to heat. I order skincare products from their respective retailers now since I keep receiving products that are extremely hot to the touch, even though they were probably sitting in a (hopefully) air-conditioned Amazon van.","July 26, 2021"

Almost every order (although thru prime) does NOT arrive at the time promise.  I pay for and use prime because it USED to have a speedy delivery.  I could wait almost to the 11th hour to order and get my products timely, THAT is a thing of the past!  I ordered $200 in items for an upcoming vacation and as I write this...it is 4 days until my vacation but my packages states that it is running late. The delivery times and dates perpetually change.  This is baffling to me because I made sure that ALL of my items was on Prime delivery so that I could get them before my vacation. I am NOT calling customer service again because I found out by an Amazon worker that they are only reading your order details from the same platform that we see our order.  So they are absolutely useless.  In compensation, they had out a measley $5 credit.  WTH is $5 on a $200 order???  It would be helpful for them to actually track the package up to calling the truck OR driver that has the package.  But I get the feeling that even if they did that, they would would be on the phone with the drivers ALL day, FURTHER delaying our products.  I want to cancel my membership and stop paying for Prime because an 70% of my deliveries are not PRIME!  This is just ridiculous!","July 25, 2021"

Ordering at Xmas time at peak time you might not get it next day which is understandable. Also as for deliveries I’ve nothing but praise for those people who run about like blue arsed flies and yet for amount of orders I’ve made never once have they failed to deliver my items, yes maybe once or twice over 15 years it been slightly late but that’s always been down to the time of year example week leading up to Xmas where it’s just chaos. Anyway as a whole I’ll judge Amazon based on 15 years I’ve been using it and all I’ll say is big thumbs up from me, it’s saved my butt many a time at Xmas buying present for family and friends, the quality of the items have been top notch very rarely have I had any problems, delivery has always been top - in fact writing this I’d say the only thing that does get me down little is there’s an old man (maybe early 70’s) who appears to be driving about in his own car (maybe he’s 3rd party delivery don’t know) and he’s been doing the deliveries around our area for couple of years now would be nice to see him get his own van rather using his own small car to do the deliveries.

Where they really falter is in customer service.  I was locked out of my account for unknown reasons and I had to go through a whole rigmarole trying -- unsuccessfully -- to get back into it.  The belligerent, unapologetic operator I spoke to was acting as if I had put HIM out.  I couldn't take it anymore and disconnected the call.

There have been a couple of unpleasant experiences but it’s to be expected when most of all my gazillion purchases are Amazon.  In rural areas, Amazon does there best to get packages to customers but expecting 2 day deliveries is unrealistic, 4 days has been the maximum time I’ve waited.  To lift the burden off Amazon, if I didn’t need the item, I’d click on standard shipping but the packages came quicker than if I didn’t have prime.  My hope is that Mr. Bezos opens an Amazon distribution center in Niagara Falls and a kiosk retail store would bring lots of people from the entire WNY area and Canada.

The first two purchases were packaged differently despite practically being the same product, and that is because I bought them from two different sellers. You'd think Amazon would have some consistency and standards even across different sellers, but no. In my case, the biggest complaint here is that the second order was packaged in an inadequate way (it was inside a plastic bag), which created a serious privacy situation I am not going to talk about and which caused me a little bit of embarrassment and fear. Nowadays, it seems like you can inadvertently buy an item from a non-Amazon seller and then end up having such an inconsistent customer service...Amazon should vet sellers more rigorously and enforce some standards. My third order was nothing short of infuriating, it was packaged even worse than my second one, it was a small paperback categorized as a magazine, which meant I could not leave a feedback on how it was handled, something I discovered only when I attempted to do so despite the fact I distinctly remember there being an option to leave an opinion somewhere in the package\receipt itself. And yeah, it was inside a bubble wrap envelope, so it arrived slightly damaged. If only Amazon packaged their products better, I'd seriously consider continuing being a customer, but as of right now, I have to shop from local sellers. Oh, and for God's sake, add the possibility of using PayPal accounts as payment methods, that's also one of the main obstacles.","May 26, 2021"

I have something delivered to my house almost weekly, UPS and FedEx never has an issue. I don’t know if it’s the GPS app that Amazon drivers are using but it is TERRIBLE! I am constantly calling them with complaints and every time they ask if I want to update my delivery info. Like HELLO!!!! I don’t have any update, it’s my dang address I can’t change it because the drivers are incapable of finding it even though no one else has an issue.I have literally put on my account a step by step direction breakdown from both ways you can access my address and it is extremely detailed. Their excuse this time was the driver did try calling, well I’m sorry I live in TX and when I see WA number I am not going to answer. I mean a reasonable thing to do would send a text message or call and then leave a message saying I will try to call you back one more time in five minutes. But no, let’s call once and then do some message on your Amazon account (which is a new feature) and try to start a chat that way... 1. Didn’t even know that was a thing 2. I don’t have Amazon notifications “enabled” on my phone, so that is useless. What makes matters worse is when I call and ask them to track the package to the driver hauling it, they can’t retrieve that info and couldn’t transfer me to someone who could. Ummm, I’m sorry. I work for an acetylene gas company and I can track down the driver, truck number and trailer number with whatever customer product we are shipping out. If I can do that then they can track down the driver. They have done it before, and he did confirm it was an amazon driver not a third party. But that is horribly inefficient on Amazon if you can’t track packages down to that extent. Sorry for the rant. But I am incredibly tired of Amazon and the incompetent drivers that they have employed. Switch GPS apps or go back to using UPS. Canceling my meme er ship looks better and better every day, only reason why I haven’t yet is because I’m holding out hope. But I’m almost out of hope.","May 26, 2021"

I never had any problem.They refund items that never get here on the date its supposed to come. The only problem I've ever had with Amazon was with one incident with a customer service representative. I inquired about an order and he was giving someone else's and I told him that it isn't mine's. He wasn't  listening and repeating it over and over.. This went on for for 15 minutes and I told him to refer me to another customer service representative because he clearly was not understanding. He said, "" No, I'm the only one here and the only one you're going to talk to."" I laughed and hung up. Then called again, got a different rep and resolved my issue in 5 minutes. Never had the kind of problem again. I don't know what the pressure the rep went through prior to my call. Maybe he had a bad call prior to that. Customer Service is not easy. There are many challenges dealing with variety of people daily. I gave it a 5 star because out of a hundred transactions and interactions with Amazon,  I only had one bad one. That's pretty good in my book. There is no perfect company. I like companies that try to make it right. Amazon does. At least with.me.","May 19, 2021"

I had the pleasure of having Nancy help resolve an issue I had with an order that never showed up. The package was to arrive on Sunday from some odd company (dynamex) but it stated delayed. That is fine by me but this happened Monday and Tuesday also. On Wednesday it said it was delivered on the order but it never was. I reached out and Nancy was a huge help. She thought seeing it delayed for 3 days and instead of giving me the number to the delivery carrier she called with me on the phone. The carrier oddly said that the items were being returned because of issues for drop off. You only need to take 20 steps and you are at my front door so I did not understand that. Nancy went through the steps and refunded my money for me and while I was on the phone we started speaking. Such a wonderful person, upbeat, cheery, and above all helpful. At times, customer service reps may not be in the happiest mood but try to think who they may have dealt with earlier because their those that do a wonderful job and need to be thanked.

Of course I was upset but making things worse I couldn't barely understand the lady so a lot of sorry, say again but she keep talking over me and telling me my sister didn't get my credit card number. I ask for management, after being on hold long enough I hung up and called back, again someone I could not understand and I said am not wanting to be rude but can I have someone who speaks English.  After being put on hold was than disconnected, this person did call me back but was again disconnected.  It's stressful enough but than it makes things even worse when trying to understand the person. I called for for 3rd time, now this time I could understand a little better. Didn't feel like they took the issue seriously and tried to tell me again they don't give out card numbers and doesn't show on account except last 4. My sister has no way of knowing what our information is but gave me last four numbers of my card and it ask if she wanted order sent to my address.

I used to love Amazon, now all I want to do is avoid it.  The last few items I ordered all sent me notifications about my item being delivered earlier than expected, it's usually only a day or so.  And yes, it is Amazon that is sending me these notifications.  All of those items either arrived on the original estimated delivery date or later.  Why continuously feed your customers false information?  How about you update your tracking systems or at least get them in working order?  It's disappointing when you're notified about literally every item you order being delivered earlier than expected, waiting all day for said item, waiting almost another 24 hours for tracking information to update again, then getting the item later than the original delivery date anyway.  It's ridiculous, and it's actually forcing me to have to use other sites because if I order anything off of Amazon it's become a 50/50 chance whether or not I get my package on time or at this point, at all.  I understand that there are delays because of COVID or whatever the excuse is these days.  But just stop sending false notifications about things being delivered early then.  I'm sorry, but if I order an item that's coming from China, I should not be getting a notification the same day that it's going to be delivered literally the next day.  It not.  Items coming from 1 state away from me don't even come the next day.  I've never done overnight or next-day, and probably never will because cost is outrageous.

A Amazon delivery cargo truck pulled up to the end of my 340 ft long driveway in February at about 9 am. It has snowed (3"") in the early morning and temperatures hovered below freezing. The driver and his assistant, after some discussion out in the road, opened the truck and the driver took the 6 ft x 4ft, 85 lbs box out. Holding it over his head originally then on his shoulder, they (the assistant was walking behind him) started down the driveway. About 20 ft. in, he slipped and fell dropping the table and falling on his side. Concerned, I went out to see if he was injured. After rolling a bit, he got up swearing and brushing himself off as anyone would expect. Before I got there, he starts yelling to his assistant about the snow, the ice, etc.  When I was getting close I asked if he was ok... he ripped into a colorful rant about the ice and why I didn't clear my driveway, etc.   I am a Safety and Risk Field Inspector for a major Insurance Carrier certified to teach many OSHA topics that cover this event starting with how to carry an 85 lb package (clearly stated on the box as requiring 2 people by the way & no hand truck??), the dangers of walking on snow covered surfaces and proper foot wear (he had sneakers on), etc.    Bottom line... he leaves the package on the side of the driveway as it started to freezing rain.   After calling Amazon and reporting the event, they agreed to accept the package return if there was any damages. There was and it was picked up by UPS a couple days later, shrink wrapped as the cardboard box was mulch by then.  Two months later, I receive notice of a $179.75 refund.  After 15 minutes of trying to find some means of contacting Amazon.... I text conversation to a Customer Service person who refunded the balance citing they had deducted a Re Stocking fee from the original refund.    Long message but.... their drivers need training in material handling and customer service. Amazon is difficult at best to contact if you have an issue and I hope to never see another delivery from an Amazon truck (their local center has been told this directly).  I will admit that once you do get to talk to someone, they do address the issues.... its getting there that sucks.","April 20, 2021"

They no longer allow freedom of expression etc...Other examples I’ve experienced:They state the policy that you can select delivery option like where to deliver your pack if you are not home. BUT the standard is that if you chose not to request a specific location at your home then the delivery person will bring it to your door (because you are home)...in my case I have had them drop a package in the mailbox down stairs on a number of occasions, only for me to find out hours later that I have waited...Also PRIME has increased buy $30.00 over the last two years and for what? I don’t use any of the prime services except the no longer existing 2 day delivery service...now when you order something while having a prime account...it may take over a week to receive as in my current case.Amazon has gone to lengths to make it short of impossible to find out where a product is shipped from ie China....which a lot of Amazon’s products actually do come from...but the problem is the shipping delays the come with ordering out of China.I give Amazon 2 ⭐️ stars and hope that they will improve their business plan to treat paying customers better. Meanwhile I’ll be looking for someone else to take Amazon’s place","April 19, 2021"

I contacted them twice! First I received a ""does not go against guidelines"" spiel, because no-one obviously even read the message. I went through the steps that it said to take if I thought it needed a second review. The second time they didn't even bother to write me anything.    Almost immediately after, I guess I bothered them too much with not wanting people to get scammed, because they blacklisted me from being able to write reviews and took all my old ones down. Saying that my review activity was ""suspicious"". Oh yes, because detailed reviews and being nice are now signs of some sort of review conspiracy to make the world a better place! What's really suspicious, is that they are allowing (and by inaction encouraging) fraud on their customers. I think they don't care how they get the money, even if those products killed someone, they will ignore complaints because they want their cut of those sellers money.

So again I tried giving Amazon another…,So again I tried giving Amazon another chance to get it right and yet again they FAILED BIG TIME!!! I purchased Amazon prime again per Amazon request to give them another chance and they had gotten better. I returned 2 items and it stated that my refund would go back to the card it was paid with but that did not happen Amazon chose to put my refund on a gift card and top it off with taking the $12.99 prime fee from it. I called about this matter to which a representative would try to convince me that I chose to put it on a gift card. NO MA’AM I DID NOT! I was then told that because my refund was put on a gift card and the prime was deducted from it that it couldn’t go back on the purchase card. So you’re telling me that because Amazon decided to make an unauthorized decision to move my payment to a card I did not ask for and no one can explain why??? Oh that’s not good... I’m not understanding this at all. The returns were requested day of delivery and returned the next day or so. This move really just annoyed me. I don’t feel I can trust Amazon. You played with my money yet again and during the WRONG TIME...Canceled Membership and service... App Deleted... Very disappointed...,"March 16, 2021"

However in the recent month's/week's I have had many problems with item's that I have purchased or others have purchased for me from my wish list, that have been delivered damaged. Especially Easter Eggs!I understand wholeheartedly that item's do from time to time arrive damaged. However, in this instance it has been a reoccurring problem. I have even had item's delivered that were damaged before they had even left the depot. Just purely down to how the item's were packaged.I also feel it is out of order for Amazon to ask to have the item/s to be returned. Due to the fact that not only that the item's were damaged by Amazon or the delivery drivers but also that the customer has to pay for the item/s to be collected/returned. Customer's shouldn't have to return or pay for anything for damages that were caused by either Amazon and/or their delivery drivers. Adding to that, the collection company they have merged with are Hermes & Hermes aren't exactly a great company. So this can also be problematic!I hope that Amazon can resolve this major issue in the hopes that we the customers can just have a delivery without any issues or concerns. Please deal with these matters Amazon.Thanks.","March 07, 2021"

After two more days (my parents put all their deliveries into a two day quarantine atm) my father opened the package and inside was a packet of ground coffee and no phone... luckily due to problems in the past he photos every package before he opens them (I think I will start doing the same after this), and upon further inspection the seal had clearly been tampered with.I used the live chat service to contact Amazon, and was expecting a difficult time, but the opposite was true.  The customer service rep (Joy) was really helpful, and after answering all her questions and emailing her the photos she quickly spoke to her manager, and arranged for a replacement to be delivered the next day!I think its only fair to give Amazon credit where it is due, (I have reviewed them low for a bad experience prior to this) most people are quick to give a low review but not so when things go well.If anyone from Amazon reads this - thank you for your help today.","March 01, 2021"

I have ordered regularly and never encountered an issue with Amazon, the website or seller conduct. 99% of the time the couriers are very reliable too, but if you have something negative to say regarding couriers, then I really don't understand why you would take time out of your life to review Amazon badly for a counter party service. Why not review the courier negatively. Ultimately whilst you can hold Amazon accountable for the failings of a poor courier service, as long as Amazon rectify the matter then you really shouldn't set out to tarnish their reputation on Trust Pilot, due to what is most likely the individual human error of a complacent delivery driver. One fair issue that I will raise however, is that Amazon really should make it easier to raise disputes with sellers, and Amazon directly where matters may remain unresolved. I have had one case(albeit out possibly a hundred purchases or more), where the item just didn't arrive, and the seller didn't respond. In the end I just gave up rather than chase a matter that wasn't straight forward.","February 16, 2021"

However just recently it's been a bit of a joke. A couple of items arrived damaged. Thankfully it's just the box not the product itself but it makes you wonder about how they treat your items. Then I also pay for Amazon Prime, the idea being next day delivery. Ordered an item and didn't receive it next day. Following day I got a notification to say it would arrive with a couple of additional items i bought as accessories for my main item. The additional items came but not the main one. Message from them saying there was a problem and I was to wait 2 more days and then I could request a refund. Wasn't sure if that meant I wasn't getting it or not, even though it said they would redeliver it 2 days later (3 days after the delivery date I pay a premium for). But why even bring up the option of a refund if you intend to deliver my item? Then at just before 2am, I get a message saying I won't get it at all. And I will get a refund in a couple of days. So I pay a premium for you to make me wait longer than expected and then not send the item and make me wait for a refund. No explanation either. It's really annoying. Makes me think twice about using them again and makes me wonder about Prime membership.","February 07, 2021"

In my disappointment I started a return when I was offered a replacement item to be shipped to me next day and I had a month to return to one I had with missing pieces for free, using a UPS pickup, just had to confirm that it I didn’t return the item the full cost would be charged to my original payment method, which couldn’t happen, this was a splurge, but since I was absolutely returning it I wasn’t worried about this and agreed. Since I was bored and decided that I could still mess around with the machine without the optional accessories that were to be included I set it up and started reading through the manual when in it I discovered basically a hidden storage compartment in the base of the machine. Open it up and ta-da there’s my “missing” accessories. So I hurry up and try to cancel the replacement but it has already shipped so I can’t, okay no problem I’ll just return it when it gets here. While laughing with my mom about my little blonde moment she mentions that she would like to learn to sew and wants to buy this machine off of me, okay no problem I just have to get ahold of Amazon and have them change the payment method they will charge when I don’t return it since I didn’t want the charge on a credit card. Contact CS through the chat feature and explain that I no longer wish to return either machine and that I need to pay for the replacement one but need to change my payment method. CS Rep asks me to wait for a few moments while she sees if this is something she can do, when she responds she says that she is unable to change the payment method after an order has been placed, but that I haven’t been charged. Confused at this point I tell her I know I haven’t been yet because I was to return one machine but that I will no longer be returning it and I agreed to be charged the full amount for both if I didn’t send one back and that I was just trying to pay for the second machine. At this point she tells me she understands all of this, and that what she was trying to say is that she will switch the replacement to a return so that I can keep both machines and not be charged for the second one. At this point I’m floored, but this was my mistake, and I’m not trying to not pay for it, I just want to use a different card to pay for it, why should Amazon give me a free machine just because I can’t change a payment method on a machine I wouldn’t have even needed shipped to me had I dug a little deeper in search of the accessories? Again she confirms that I can keep both machines with no charge for the second machine, also that she will send me email confirmation of this at my request, just in case a charge shows up on my card because this seems to good to be true. Within 30 seconds of ending the chat I have email confirmation of keeping both machines and not being charged for the second one. Wow. Thank you Amazon, you made myself and my mother very very happy yesterday. Never would have dreamed I would end up with a free mid level Brother sewing machine by contacting Amazon in an attempt to PAY for said sewing machine just because they don’t have the ability to change my payment method. Still in shocked disbelief, I guess the karma gods were happy with me yesterday.","January 25, 2021"

When I got there, no locker was ready under my name and I had to ask the office manager to manually open the locker (the locker in which the Amazon driver had taken a photo of). The product ended up being for someone else within the complex. So, I called Amazon customer service.. and I was told my product was not “lost” and the neighbor with my package may return my package. Well, here’s the problem.. the reason we got a package concierge in the first place was due to package theft that was going around. The rep said he didn’t know what else he could do for me. First of all, he didn’t do anything; he basically said to wait on my neighbors to.. NO, it’s Amazon’s responsibility to make sure I receive my package, not my neighbors! If I don’t receive it and you can’t track it, then it is LOST.

I watched the service decline steadily over the years while the price went up. At first it was free 2 day shipping on most items and overnight for 2.99. since then the overnight option is gone completely except a very few items that are sicken in their local warehouse and delivered by then.Also home is the standard 2 day shipping. What you get now is 2 day on SOME items if you're lucky and a good portion of a week or even longer on most others.  They'll tell you it's because of Covid issues but this began before the pandemic, they just seen to be taking advantage of the situation as a handy excuse. I'll be plenty surprised if prime ever goes back to even close to what it was. Every ""temporary"" reduction in service I've ever seen becomes permanent after you've had enough time to forget the promise. All this and now prime has crept up over $100 and climbing, while benefits keep dropping.Then there's the products. The cheap made in China junk keeps dominating while Amazon keeps refusing to make listing country of manufacturer (made in...) mandatory. It's obvious why. And the deceptive practices by many sellers is still allowed. Easy removal of negative feedback, placing low prices items that don't exist and marking them as out of stock while directing you to other, higher priced, products by the same company. Mixing reviews from multiple products not even offered in the same details page to provide highly deceptive ratings and falsely inflated review numbers. This has got to be the most egregious bit of false advertising on the site, and Amazon allows it to continue unchecked, presumably because it helps sell product which makes them money.Then there is the search function which is next to useless. It will ignore the search terms every time and return whatever it thinks it can sick you into buying. There are no logical operators that I can find to restrict the search such as ""this AND that NOT the other"". If I ask for specific brand of widget, even in the filters, it will mix in whatever crap is even close from any brand. All the filter does is throw in a few extra items of the brand I want. I shouldn't get to page three of the search results and find more items of my chosen brand after wading through a page and a half of unwanted items.All this and there is NO WAY to give feedback to Amazon itself on its service. Any complaint, support, or questions page you go to will ONLY accept feedback about third party sellers or specific items. This is an indication that Amazon is fully aware of how customer unfriendly they are and have no intention of paying attention to their customer's complaints. They have abandoned all semblance of being a 'customer service' company and are begging for government regulation. I don't like to see over regulation by the government but this is how it happens, I have zero sympathy for Amazon.","January 17, 2021"

Here's the catch - the shipping and delivery portion of the order is so awful that it supercedes and cancels out the good. When you order something from other sites, it gives you a delivery date and that's it; the item is there as expected. With Amazon it's a crapshoot! Very, very few orders ever show up on time and that's inexcusable. The cost of shipping is built into the cost of my membership, so remember nothing is free. They give you no recourse for late shipments. I order things with plenty of time but when you're expecting a delivery it should be there. My daughter's birthday present is already TWO DAYS late and the only offer is a refund, but then they reverse the shipment and that's not feasible because I still need the product. They shouldn't be allowed to charge you a fee if they don't hold up their end of the agreement. I'm not ordering from them anymore. It's time to get back to shopping small, local businesses again.

The Delivery showed it would be delivered by Monday. This was perfect because I was a gift for a birthday party on Wednesday evening. So Monday comes and the item was still showing delivery by 10pm. Then I get an email Monday evening stating that there was a “delay”. So I look at the shipping history and it showed departed from the hub and never an arrival anywhere. I waited until Tuesday late afternoon to check again and still no update. I contacted the customer service through chat and they were RUDE. They were giving my answers to questions I never asked. Just needed to know if the item was lost or not. I live close to a prime hub and have friends that work there. They stated that anytime a package arrives or departs it is scanned and updated. The item is lost and May or may not show up somewhere. Probably be delayed by several days. The customer service chat rep stated that I had to wait another day to cancel the order. When asked to speak to a supervisor they started that they had already connected their supervisor and that the information they relayed. When asked to speak with the supervisor or manager they stated that I would get the same answer. So I ended the chat and requested a call. Informed the agent that I would like to talk to a supervisor or manager so I didn’t have to repeat the issue another two times. He stated that he needed to see if he could resolve the issue first. I explained everything again and then stated I would have to talk to a supervisor. So the third time explaining the situation I was able to cancel the order however not without a lot of sighs and condescending attitude.

Firstly there is a lot of low quality third party sellers on the site. It's getting very difficult to find quality and avoid the trash. So much so that it's not a place to make a lot of big purchases when you can go to more selective companies that don't just rack and stack.Second, their delivery guys will do anything to record a completed delivery. Leaving boxes over the fence, in the rain and when it's a fragile item. Not a good idea. The bad is easily outweighed by the good though. Returns are a breeze, delivery is nearly always on time, even around the holiday season.  On the few occasions I have had to contact a real person they have been quick to respond and very good at solving the problem. I think Amazon have shown that they super successful by being slightly better than the competition, most who set a very low bar. So a long way from perfect but still an easy recommend","January 03, 2021"

Amazon has also been in the news for things like their poor treatment of fulfillment center employees by timing how many seconds they take to pick an order and pack it, limiting bathroom breaks, and making workers work during Covid-19 even though several of their employees got Covid-19 in their fulfillment centers.  So why do you ask do i keep buying from a company like this? for one simple reason, convenience. Amazon has a huge selection of products, they allow for easy and FREE returns within 30 days where other competitors charge restocking fees for returns and make returns at customer expense for shipping costs. Amazon also has a presence in many countries, ive purchased stuff from Amazon Japan, Amazon UK and had the items shipped to the United States very easily.So why did I rate Amazon.com 3/5? well because while they may be very convenient to buy from they also have very poor packaging and dont let customers specify what kind of packaging they want their items shipped in. Amazon has gotten some heat from environmental groups trying to get them to cut down on plastic and cut down on cardboard boxes in the past and we still see petitions online constantly being opened about their packaging. A simple solution would be to let the customer choose what kind of packaging they want their items shipped in during the checkout process and if theres an extra costs associated with more packaging materials then the customer can decide if they want to pay the extra costs or not. I would totally welcome the ability to choose what packaging material Amazon uses for my orders because I would love to be able to order things like art books, movies, collectibles, and video games from Amazon but whenever I try to order any of these items from Amazon they ship the items in a plastic padded envelope 99% of the time or a cardboard box without any packing paper or void fillers and when I finally receive the item it will be all scuffed up or dented during shipping, have a loose disc (movies and video games), or be damaged in some other way so I would have to go through the trouble of returning the item back to Amazon which isnt good for the environment either since it would costs more fuel and packaging material to be sent back to Amazon. The combination of Amazon's business practices, their poor treatment of fulfillment center employees, and their poor quality packaging which prioritizes getting the package to the customer as fast as possible over the condition that the items arrive in at their destination are the reasons why I gave Amazon a 3/5 score.","January 01, 2021"

You can't criticize Amazon about their own products and services on Amazon.,"For the price, Amazon is great! But as far as reviews. They're suspect. And most customers use the reviews to help them purchase products. So, it goes without saying that it helps the bottom line. For example, I reviewed a product I previously gave a 4-star based on the price-point-to-quality, but then the seller offered me an Amazon gift card to give them a 5-star instead! I promptly gave them a 2-star...just for that. My thought was ""how many of these so-called 5-stars are paid for?"" Basically, dishonesty is a minus 2 star to me. So I wrote about it in my critique. Guess what? Amazon removed it. Why? Because it was against guidelines. What in the world are they talking about? I read through the guidelines and there's nothing there that suggest I can't change my rating or that I can't criticize someone for bribing me to give them a rating they want. In fact, I another review and it kept getting removed. The only ones left were 4 to 5-star ratings. And criticize Amazon's products and service itself? Wo, Amazon will warn you that you're somehow violating their guidelines. You can criticize other products and services they sell through Amazon, but stuff that Amazon does they don't want you to criticize. The truth of the matter is there are cheaper places to get stuff at. In fact, I've reduced my expenditure on Amazon to 80% online purchases to 50% online purchases. You just have to do your due-diligence as a consumer. The 5% back is an attractive feature Amazon has, but sometimes you can save more than that in other distributors. Amazon is like the Facebook of retail sales, eventually you realize you shouldn't really be supporting a model that doesn't actually represent the free-market and democratic principles we Americans hold...even if you have to pay an extra buck elsewhere.","December 18, 2020"

You know, the ones on the product detail page. For Example Prime member's, delivery is stated two days, sometimes three days. these delivery dates are always stated right on that page. But  following my last purchase, I received a notice that the product delivery date had been extended by two or three days. (So I canceled the purchase). And now I find that Prime Video has commercials... COMMERCIALS. Folks, I do not pay a monthly fee for commercials. I get enough of that with Directv. This was one reason I chose a prime membership. I do not pay a monthly fee to have my delivery date made LATE  by two or three days. The date on the product details page. (And I always take a screenshot of the page at the time of the purchase) should be the same price and date that the product is actually delivered. When I purchase products from Amazon, I often choose the product according to the delivery date and that price and delivery date should be honored by Amazon. If there are too many deliveries, hire more drivers. There are lots of people wanting jobs right now. Amazon needs to be a little bit more aware of their “little details”, like the delivery dates. It is now time to purchase items for Christmas. My question is, can I depend on Amazon with delivering the products on time? Or are my gifts going to arrive in 2021.","November 30, 2020"

Most of time they do a decent job. Except for the way too many deliveries that were placed at other people’s addresses. Which I have complained about and customer service has mostly been great. This last incident though has really upset me. Yesterday I was supposed to be getting an item for a project. I have family flying into town over thanksgiving and needed to have this project done before they get here. Amazon marked it as delivered to a secure location but nothing had been delivered. I contacted customer service and they were great. They refunded the purchase price and assured me that it was marked as delivered in error and I would still get the item. Which shortly after I did receive it. However, I have 2 aquariums and one crashed so I had to move my German blue ram to a 10 gallon tank. Seeing he was so stressed in the 10 gallon I bought a 20 long from petco to rehouse him. The other other items I ordered from Amazon were an air pump, background and a heater that were supposed to arrive the next day. So, amazon decided to make sure I didn’t get those items in the timeframe they were supposed to be delivered. Now, I have to deal with a stressed almost dead blue ram because amazon decided to retaliate and say all my items needed for the 20 gallon were not going to arrive for another 24 to 48 hours since I complained they day before. If my blue ram dies because of amazon not delivering my items on the day I needed them, I’m going to raise hell. We have been paying for prime for years now. Amazon should take responsibility for delivering on the day they said they would. And not wait until the day of delivery then just tell you it’s running late. I really did not want to be still trying to set up this tank while family is here over the holidays. And for anyone who has a fish tank or a blue ram, you know it is time sensitive emergency situation. Bad on amazon for delaying my orders because I complained the day before.","November 23, 2020"

If you are looking for a specific item they neither have it or they don't, and if they don't they will have something very similar. I have 90% success/satisfaction in finding what I'm looking for. In the remaining 10% of the time its a different story. Case in point:  I'm currently shopping for a pair of blue light reading glasses. Im a petite woman with a narrow face. In search Bar I type in,""women's blue light reading glasses in narrow width."" I also select women's and narrow in  the filter and sort section to eliminate everything else, as there are THOUSANDS to choose from. So.....You would expect women's narrow blue light readers right?  NOPE! The very first selections are  men's/women's blue light readers. Now obviously if the glasses are unisex they would look ridiculous on a skinny 97 lb woman. They do list women's only glasses, but no matter how you word it, amazon simply ignores the so called filters and you end up having to scroll through thousands of unisex glasses instead of having the convenience of shopping for women's only glasses. Needless to say, I did NOT waste my time with amazon. I went to the eyebops site, where customized shopping was successful, and I found a great pair of glasses in under 10 minutes. I don't know why Amazon chooses to ignore what the customer specifically wants. Why do they even have the filters?

I have had to wait for a week for an items to be shipped with a prime account. No reason to have a prime now since I dont get my stuff in 2 days anymore. It's hard to reach customer service.

Unfortunately, since September there has been a shift in Amazon's Cust. Reps. It simply isn't what it used to be.Whenever an item needs returning or replacement, I have easily spent 4 to 6 hours speaking to Amazon to resolve the issue The reps are mostly from India. They have a tendency to ask the same question several times using different words. They like the sound of their own voice. The initiate return and send confirmation email (without providing a label), however, they cancel the ""return"" within mins of you getting of the chat or call.The repetition is extraordinary. I have now moved to other pine retailers as I have found myself recieving incorrect or damaged goods from Amazon and on top of which I spend more time talking to Amazon then to my own family.

Quality is generally very good and I keep the products that I buy. I love the included 2-day shipping with Prime, as well as other benefits such as Prime video. I also like how easy it is to return a product - just drop it off at your local kohls and you're set - boom, super easy! With that said, Amazon is not perfect. When I've needed to get a hold of customer support, they have been very helpful, however, it's not always clear as to how to get a hold of someone. I will also say, Amazon does have a significant issue with allowing knock-offs to run rampant on their site.

The Amazon rep told me to return the damaged shipment for refund and reorder the damaged order. I returned the original product in the same box it arrived in.

Also, it seems their quality control has decreased in recent years and is going in the same direction, which is down, which makes it easier for competition to be, well, competitive and give consumers other options when dissatisfied, and that's good for consumers because we can express our dissatisfaction by using simple economics and give our consumer dollars to the competitor with the best, or nearly best, offer.

Getting very disillusioned with Prime delivery/promised delivery dates. Prime promises same day, next day, two day delivery depending upon the product you order.  1) I expect delay of specific or some products due to COVID-19; and, 2) I understand not all products can be delivered in a day.  However, it's now October and I would expect Amazon to have worked-out the majority of promised delivery vs. actual delivery issues, regardless of whether it is an Amazon issue or Prime vendor issue.  Of the orders I have placed over the past 2-3 months, 80%+ have arrived later -- sometimes MUCH later -- than the delivery date stated/selected when I order.  In general, it is an inconvenience.  In principle, Amazon is not fulfilling the terms of their PAID Prime Service.  I would much rather order a product and get an HONEST, REALISTIC delivery date than continue to get notifications that the product I've ordered is delayed.  In some cases, I would not use Amazon if I knew that my order would not arrive for as much as a week to 10 days after the original delivery date.  Prime is a paid Service, with specific consumer promises.  Amazon needs to fulfill these promises or change them.  In all fairness, prior to COVID-19 the percentages of late packages was probably reversed (20% late/80% on time).  COVID is a challenge for everyone, and Amazon needs to step up to the plate to adjust their business practices to it.Side note:  First tried to review/leave feedback on the Amazon site but I'm ineligible to review Prime Service there.

I guess I'm old-fashioned or maybe just old. I'm happy to report the shopping online at Amazon has been very satisfying and so much easier than I thought it would be. I have no trouble ordering or finding items that I wish to order I have utilized customer service and they have always been 100% helpful. My deliveries have all been on time and in a few cases actually early. The delivered packages were all in great shape. Amazon is definitely my go-to for all of my online purchases and the first place I go to look for anything I wish to buy .

Bruce Johnson,/users/5f8fd9196d3b5a001b17f8ac,US,8 reviews,2020-10-21T06:45:59.000Z,2,"Amazon good, lots of room for improvement","There are some aspects of Amazon that are fantastic and other parts that are not. This speaks to the character of the leadership (Jeff Bezos) more than anything else. The best part of Amazon is the selection. You can find anything there. And sometimes they even have the best price. The convenience of the site (huge selection) makes me willing to spend a little more, at times. Amazon Prime is nice and gives a lot of great features. Sure the free shipping is nice but not worth the cost of membership. You can still get free shipping, it just takes a little longer. The Prime Video and music help make up the difference. So if you like to watch lots (and I mean lots) of Sci-Fi channel, low budget films then you will love prime video. But remember to keep an eye on your watch list. Amazon has limited time contracts with a lot of content. And thing leave prime all the time.Now for the ""Needs Improvement"". Amazon delivery and their guaranteed delivery is not so guarantied. The 1 or 2 day delivery begins not when you place the order, but when they actually ship it. To date 30% of deliveries have been late.  Not a day late but closer to a week late. Sometimes even longer. I have had item guarantied by Friday get rescheduled late Thursday or early Friday for as much as 2 weeks later. When this happens I start the return and get it locally (often at a higher price) take of what I was working on and when the item from Amazon finally shows up I take the package and label to UPS or Kohls, whichever is on the label.Now when you call and complain, they may refund your money, if it is a non-returnable, but they do not care that they were late or the consequences of missing a delivery. So a $20 or $30 refund does not really make things right. It never reimburses people who may have been expecting something special (a Childs birthday gift, a Mother's day gift, etc.) or the extra trouble you now go through to make it right for that special person. And to be blunt, it is the lack of empathy or caring on the part of Amazon that is the most depressing and proves that money is the bottom line at Amazon.The delivery drivers vary, some do a great job and show some care when making the delivery and others just toss the package over the fence or onto the porch. Not good when the contents are fragile. They actually ask for feedback on deliveries so maybe this will improve, but I doubt it. When breakage occurs it gets returned.The other down side is they do not allow any negative feedback in any reviews. This is one thing they do not tell you. Just mentioning that Amazon missed a delivery date, or you are less than totally satisfied with your experience, and your review will not be posted. This speaks poorly about the Amazon corp. culture and this is why I doubt Amazon will ever improve. If they were more open and honest with customers we might have more faith in them but that is not the case. You have to wonder what else they are hiding.So my experience is that if it super critical that you get it on time (repairing you only vehicle before work on Monday) get it from the dealer or your local parts source. Do not buy it from Amazon because they will likely miss their delivery.","October 21, 2020"

My package sat out on my doorstep all night and I didn't know it was their until I checked my e-mail this morning.  The driver didn't bother to knock or use the doorbell, just set it down, took a picture for the e-mail notifying me of it's arrival, and left.  I live in a low crime area, but it could have been stolen and I wouldn't know until I got the e-mail.  The small courtesy of a knock or a ring of the doorbell isn't really that much to ask, is it, Amazon?  Also, the customer service bot is ineffectual when you try to notify them of this problem and there is NO e-mail address you can write to for customer service.  I'd rather not wait indefinitely for someone one to possibly get around to calling me when they have time.","October 16, 2020"

When their customer service agents say someone will get back to you, know that they will never get back to you.  Have heard that at least a dozen separate times and never once has anyone got back to me.They can usually correct things pretty quick, but the problems thst get them there are usually pretty bad and they do nothing or very little to mitigate the issue.Overall I still buy from them because of the pricing but I am starting to slow down on purchases because their poor resolution on multiple problems has had me spend way too much time on the phone with them correcting their mistakes while I am actually paying to correct them for them, by being a customer.I have also caught them in their own policy lies and have it recorded where the agent refuses to put in writing what he says on the phone, even though he will put other things in writing.  I asked him directly; why will you say it on the phone to me and not put it in writing, he said because he isn’t obligated to do that.  Unbelievable.I think this company is dealing with the massive influx of sales during the pandemic and though I have little sympathy for the trillions in profit... overall they do pretty good job... when they mess up it can be pretty bad... but usually they don’t mess up and usually things will sort out.  I wish I could more easily support Canadian retailers though.","October 13, 2020"

I purchased an item a week ago, and it arrived on Tuesday with the box damaged. It had a large hole on the front, and it was dented on the top left side. I posted a review about the issue, but it was rejected because it didn't follow the community guidelines. The problem is that my review was rejected, but other people who had the same problem somehow got past the system. Customer Service still insists my review is against the guidelines, yet other people can post reviews mostly about the poor quality of the packaging.

Not to much you can say about this product because its just a black roll of carpet. Wrong, my review stated it took a little time getting to me no big deal. Then i said how they folded the carpet into 2ft x 2ft square and shipped it in a fedex bag. Now folding it was a big no go and if youve done this kinda of work you know crease lines in the carpet are bad and because they shipped it in a bag it got tossed around  by FedEx which caused even more crease lines.

I don't have Prime but shipping is still very quick with the free option. Usually winds up coming through Canada Post though which has their own problems. I have had some weird issues in the past though, including getting shipped completely wrong items from amazon.ca themselves, not a third party seller. Pre-orders have been awful though, I don't think they've ever managed to complete one for me. They routinely oversell and then cancel. Customer service is pretty lousy as well, especially on pre-orders. I was strung along for months on a pre-order they oversold being assured by multiple reps on the phone that they would fulfill my order. Eventually the final delivery date passed and my order was immediately canceled.Short answer, if you have no other option they are pretty quick and reliable with in stock items.

I made an order with Primary one-day free shipping, but never got the product. 1st day it shows it will arrive today but nothing happened, I knew I won't because they even didn't ship; got an tracking number on 2nd day and promised to deliver on 3rd day, again nothing happened, the tracking only shows 2 lines of ""late in transit"" actually it had never leave the facility. 4th day it shows ""you order maybe lost, you can request refund"". Login to check my order, found that the product price was increased on both orders, guess this is why they never ship my order? I tried to leave product review, failed, saying this is not about the product. Then I tried to leave review on the seller, failed again, saying Amazon taking shipping responsibility, fine, then how can I leave a review for Amazon itself?!! Do Amazon regulate themselves, or actually they helped the seller to cheat? Yes I got refund, but I lost a week time instead of making order somewhere else, who take that responsibility? Is it Amazon big enough so that it doesn't need to care what customer think anymore?","September 28, 2020"

I have had to return many items over the years and have never had a problem with prime. You just get on line, find the product you ordered in your orders and fill out the form.

So in reality, I paid for the shipping even though the Amazon ad says ""free shipping"".  Now here is the even stranger part.  I returned it via Amazon, and because I found it at a lower price (the Olive Table in Vermont has the identical item by the same manufacturer - HF Coors) for $22, I had to pay return shipping of $4.54 via UPS which will be deducted from my refund.

I have had orders from amazon that are free shipping by them and have come come in two days Every time. I have also ordered many times on accident from third party sellers and they are usually not that much cheaper and take weeks to months to arrive with no shipping info available which truly made me almost leave amazon all together but then realized what I was doing. I do hold amazon a little responsible because if they Allow 3rd party sellers they should all be treated as amazon packages or should NOT be sold by them. But all in all if you stick to Amazon shipped and sold products you should be pleased. I would definitely recommend amazon just be careful of the sellers.,"August 21, 2020"

Top notch!","I've been ordering from Amazon since October 2016. I got to know of them when I stayed in the US for a couple of months for technical and hands-on training. I've experienced delays, items lost or damaged or even ""delivered"" but no one knocked and I was home the whole day. On the other hand, I've also experienced extra-early deliveries, being given freebies, and all that.In my years of online shopping, I've also bought from competitor platforms like Lazada, eBay, to name a few. I still buy from other platforms but what keeps me with Amazon is how I find their customer service to be. The quality is exactly what you would expect of an American company: customer-satisfaction-centered.Your experience may differ, but I can see myself ordering from Amazon for years to come simply because if they do it right, I am one happy customer; and if something is wrong, their customer service whether chat or call will get my problem resolved each time.","August 17, 2020"

(rolled eyes)I will always cancel order when they try to charge my debit card a second time. They can very well take the money that was previously put on hold but nope, they want to charge again! So I will always cancel and bring my business elsewhere even if it costs a little more.My recent order was with the same debit card and they did not charge twice. Just once, take the money and delivered the goods. Now why can't they just do that all the time?? Charging twice is off putting and defo made me shop elsewhere every time they try sh_t like that with my debit card.

And failure in one part of their service will result in bad feedback for Amazon as a whole.So during this sermon (please try to remain awake) I have put down my past experiences with Amazon and it's customer services which to date have been exceptional in resolving my past issues.I think some of the issue’s customers can experience with Amazon occur with the third-party sellers. Amazon overall does a good job of mediating issues with the third-party companies, I myself have had issues in the past with a certain unscrupulous sellers and Amazon after some investigating offered a full refunded.An item that has prime delivery is not necessarily sold by Amazon. Top tip is if you are unsure who a seller is of an item check the right pane and just below the price and the ‘Add to Basket, Buy now, Add to list’ you will see it read Dispatched from and sold by Amazon. If it does not read this it is a third party company.A massive company like Amazon does not need me to put in a good word for it. But myself included it is easier to write a bad review than a good one, as we expect the service to be good from the companies we use and rightly so.So this is me trying to balance the bad reviews I have posted with a semi-constructive review for a company that has rarely let me down, though the couriers on their behalf are another matter (yer I'm talking about you Yodel/Hermes stop putting my mail in the stinky green recycling bin when I have a garden box there right next to it!)Amazon Fan Boy out!!","August 06, 2020"

They openly support the Black Lives movement, displaying banners supporting them, suggesting antiracist books, etc. However, they showed no support for the #metoo movement even though women are statistically far more likely to be abused or murdered by men than are blacks. Do womens' lives not matter too? Also, they sell fake versions of brand names on their site consistently and fail to post customer reviews when people state this in the reviews. This is called bait-and-switch and is an illegal practice. This is a toxic company with toxic leadership selling inferior products. Almost every major company sells their goods online now. I just order directly from those companies and receive far better products at similar or lower prices. The one good thing they did was introduce whole foods delivery, although I am concerned that they will eventually cheapen and ruin that brand now that they have their grubby little claws on it.","July 19, 2020"

Great ideas, convenient and where one can often makes a good find as well as a bargain.This company as a whole is an honest company. The problem is, more and more dishonest employees working within are damaging the image of companies like Amazon. For example, I usually remove my credit/debit card from my account after paying at checkout because of fraudsters working within these large companies. Yes, they are worse than the online hackers.Amazon allows you to remove your payment card after checkout because removing your payment card after checkout on their platform does not cancel your order nor does it cancel your payment. This is a good system in my view considering that the company has a legal duty to protect your personal data including your payment cards.Recently, having removed my card after checkout, I found £150.00 debited from my account as seen on my last month statement. I phoned the company, got thought to a human and after a lengthy phone call, he could found no order on their system for the amount. They contacted my bank and it was established that I have been defrauded of £150.00 on Amazon website.I am happy to say the company's agent was helpful and the bank quickly refunded the full amount to my debit card with the Amazon's agent help.At this moment however, I cannot give the company a better rating for this particular reason, the company has thousands of employees and I figured they are paid adequately but are they property rewarded? Is it possible that internal fraudsters are getting plenty in successful companies like Amazon because sociological imagination is not evenly spread among those employees and contractors that helped Amazon to become the empire it is today?The payment to delivery drivers is not enough and this is why Amazon has been forced to find new ways to deliver its massive amount of orders to customers each day, For example, leave it at post office, a neighbour, a designated collection point. These collection and or delivery method helped Amazon to deal with the under staffed issues in delivery drivers. The question is, are they in the best interest of you the Amazon customers?The credit and debit card chargeback scheme will not refund you if the chain between the card provider and the protection it offered is broken. This means, if you, for example, selected a designated collection point for your order to be left for collection, the company delivered the order at the designated collection point but the order is stolen from that address, then the card provider would not refund you because the chain between the card provider and the protection the card offered would have been broken by the theft of the order from the address other than your address which you provided to your card provider.What is cynical with many companies like Amazon, is that they make provisions which makes life easier for themselves but at the same time, use their convoluted terms & conditions on their websites, which nobody read nor would have the time to read, to embed terms designed to protect themselves while hanging you out to dry as far as your consumers' protection rights are concerned. All this happening because we are living in a world where the 1% owned the bricks and Mortar around us.Companies, in my experience, that got so big that they struggled to meet demands at a competitive operational costs, quite often become too big for their boots. Is Amazon one such companies?","July 14, 2020"

When I received the items, I decided to return one product back because I didnt love it, so I initiated a return online for that product. The instructions for the return were to pack it back up and include a printed out receipt inside. And no need to put the address or postage or anything on the outside. Amazon Prime person would come to my door the next business day and pick up that item and I will be credited. I chose to get amazon credit when I was filing the return online. The very next day, I got the email that I got a refund and the credit was in my amazon account. Completely satisfied with the amazon service so far. No issues for me.

They're about as useful as as the animatronics found in Disney parks. It's not their fault - it's Amazon!3) Discounts on electronic gaming removed.4) Telephone # for help cleverly hidden among layers of nonsense. The phone number use to be right on the screen at all times.5) Most small shipments even if fragile, will ship in padded envelopes, which results in squashed packaging. They use to box items like that.6) Prime shipping dates have become a joke. Every week there are late shipments, despite the ""Order now and receive it by"". BULL!7) No more compensation for late shipments. Just a ""sorry""8) Jeff Bezos is the richest man in the universe, thanks to us, yet, they cut corners on everything. Why?

So therefore I'm eager to write a review. (For the first time in my life). I also wrote one on ConsumerAffairs... Unfortunately I don't have good things to say about Amazon and their attention to customer satisfaction seems below average, despite having so much attention in media about being the best and greatest company in the world. I ordered a spotting scope for my vacation. (NOTE: The item was shipped from and is sold by Amazon.com)I was searching for a certain spotting scope, and I finally found it in stock on Amazon. 14 left. So I order one ASAP. When I receive the package the next week I notice that they sent the wrong item. Well... that's a disappointment, but I would not bash a whole company just because of that. But... Then when trying to order the correct item (only ONE used sample left. fine.. ) I get an error message. I contacted Amazon and they promised me not to worry (like THREE times) and that they would fix it for me. So when they tell me not to worry that many times I trust them about getting this fixed. I get promised:1. They will make sure I will be able to order the correct item even though they seem to almost run out of stock. i.e. I assume they keep one for me. And they would get back to me when they fixed the glitch/error. I would also get 20 USD off.2. They will pick up the wrong item in 2 business day and give me a refund.Sounds great, right? Now I won't go to another company and order the correct item somewhere else, right? Outcome: 1. They DON'T get back to me. And when I reach out and ask them if they fixed the glitch so I could order the correct item they told me they could NOT, AND they have run out of stock. ..that's just great. 2. Also they STILL have not picked up the package and have yet not refund my purchase.So I contact Amazon again:After getting failed twice in a row and thus ruined my chance of getting hands on this quite rare item, I asked them how they were going to help me. Let me put it this way; they were NOT EVEN WILLING TO CHECK DELIVERY STATUS with the supplier about when they will get the item back in stock. LOL. And for the record, I've been acting very patient the whole time and have had a very decent tone in my writing to them the whole time.A normal, customer satisfaction oriented company would make more effort, but not Amazon. I expected them to provide me with perhaps the correct item that's sold from third party who has it in stock but with a price adjustment compensation (since they sold it for more money) or something similar.And even though one of the agents promised me to give me a price match in case they would change when coming back in stock, the manager I asked to speak to later on told me was misinformation and that they could not even do that. So in conclusion; Amazon failed to deliver correct item and are not willing to make any real effort to make sure I am satisfied as a customer. Hence, I will order the correct item from a competitor and let Amazon pick this wrong item up ASAP. While writing this they still have not picked up the wrong item nor refunded me. Which they initially told me would take two days. It has now been more than a week, and will take more than two weeks in total since I today asked the about this once again and told me 3-5 more business days. That's more than two business days, isn't it?

I bought a brand new Kindle Fire Tablet in mid-April mainly for reading. It’s 3 months later and the kindle won’t download books. Which is what I use the kindle for. I tried troubleshooting the problem with Google but nothing worked. I called Customer Service and after almost two hours- they said they have tried everything but downloads can take up to 4 hours and to call back in the am if it still wasn’t working. Guess what? 12 hours later and the downloads still not working even though I was charged for the books. The man at customer service this morning said he couldn’t find what was wrong and asked if he could call me back in 30 minutes. No explanation as to why. I’m doubtful they will call. Soooo- why haven’t they told me they will send a replacement? It is obvious they can’t repair it. I don’t understand why I should have to pay for something that breaks in a couple months. I’m still under warranty and so angry I’m seeing red. Worst customer service,"July 04, 2020"

Also, Prime TV is included so you cannot go wrong. I haven't explored the other parts of my membership yet but I intend to. Although there can be mixed sellers on there, it can be hard to return items if you have brought from a seller. Amazon offers a range of products so most of the time you can find it at a reasonable price. Also, Amazon has a 'Smile' link that donates a small percentage to a charity of your choice.

Their Prime service is worth the subscription. Prime shipping is the best. Ordered an Iphone 11 and received it within 18hrs from the time I ordered it. Positives:Items sold by Amazon arrive on time. Users can check their orders on the app. Negatives:Items sold by other sellers on Amazon do not always provide tracking. They often charge a fee for delivery. Be careful with repeat orders, sellers can change their shipping costs. The app does not inform the buyer of changes in the shipping fee if the seller decides to charge a different shipping fee. Moreover, when buying more than 1 item, make sure that the seller has stock. I bought window mosquito nets and only found out that 1 out of the 4 pieces I ordered as was from a different seller because the order cannot be filled by the same store. I ended up paying 9€ shipping for a 9.99€ item. That's 100% mark-up simply for shipping while the other 3 same items were shipped by another seller for free. Conclusion:As with any transaction, read the fine print.","June 04, 2020"

Amazon will not put you in touch with a live person, they will not read their emails, and they do not allow you to reach out to the vendors and possibly have them intervene.

My account was accessed by an unauthorised individual on (I think) the 15th May. This individual was then able to change the email address tied to the account, and the contact telephone number on the two-step authentication system. They then proceeded to make a small purchase using my card details, and steal a gift voucher. Amazon insists that card details must be saved on your account. This unauthorised access also affected my Alexa devices. So,on the 15th,  Amazon blocked the account and said they'd return any purchases made that wasn't me, as well as return the stolen gift voucher. A week later I'm still unable to access the account and note that my Alexa devices still believe the account is tied to someone elses email address and telephone number. I contact Amazon again to ask why this is the case. The call centre staff apologises for this and passes it off again. The email address, but not telephone details, are now back as they should be...however I STILL cannot access the account. I cannot reset the password, and cannot do anything. The automated reset system sends a code to my email, and once the code is input the website crashes. This isn't local causes. This is the case on every device tried, at home and at work. I have now sent numerous emails over the past week with NO RESPONSE at all. I've heard a lot of accounts on amazon become compromised everyday. You'd think the richest company on the planet would be able to offer slightly better protection, and maybe not insist that payment details have to be saved. - Better yet, you'd think they'd actually have the resources to work and resolve problems.***UPDATE*** Haven't received any further replies since the very beginning of this issue around 8 weeks ago. Have sent countless emails to the address the customer service helpline suggests. Receive an automatic emails stating they've received the email and will contact me back ASAP. This is a total joke so far....Return my account and return my missing gift cards!It's also wonderful to see that they don't pay any interest to their trust pilot reviews. Hardly a surprise.**** Update ****Sometime later I finally have access to my account, and my gift cards.","June 03, 2020"

Here's another example: ""CBD"" returns pages of products, none of which are CBD, they area all Hemp Oil. After researching it, Amazon doesn't sell CBD.

Now they have this automated set up for shipping that is standard but lets u pay for shipping. It wasnt always like this. So when u overlook and eventhough u meet the criteria for free shipping u will have to be  vigilant or else ull be charged shipping, it is automated that u pay for shipping. They want you to get lured to buy more and through amazon so u get free shipping. But then theres a pit stop that u will have to select free shipping. It wasnt like this before.

Amazon has been a very decent outlet to purchase items.  Recently, I've learned to take a look at items sold locally in the US.  I ordered a pair of professional nail clippers.  Not realizing it, I ordered them from overseas and learned that it would take over a month to get the order.  I looked around and found a cheaper pair in Florida and and had them within 5 days over a weekend, regular mail.  The worst is I ordered a card table.  Easy right.  It would take another month to get it, which was good timing for me.  It was shipped by UPS, Amazon put a hold on it and directed UPS to stop shipment.  When I called UPS, they said I had to contact Amazon at the their website address.  There was nothing else that I could do.  Went to contact Amazon and it was a BOT-computerized; no customer service, no help site.  I re-ordered the card table from Amazon because now I needed it and couldn't wait any longer.  After several days passed, my 2nd order for the card table was not even processed.  I decided to look around and found the exact table at Bed Bath and Beyond.  I ordered it online for the same price with a coupon and it was at my door in less than a week.  I cancelled my order at Amazon.  My business will decrease significantly at Amazon.  I don't like how you treat your employees and your service is no longer acceptable.","May 17, 2020"

Well before the pandemic Amazon was, what I would call, a masterpiece of a company.  They said your products would arrive in three days and they did.  Then they said two days...and they did.  You got a bad product, they took it back no questions asked.  They were the reason I claimed all other companies failed.  They did what needed to be done.Then shipping got less reliable.  Returns got harder.  The epitome of beautiful capitalism grew and grew, acquired and aquired and eventually, the model company became what I fear it might have always been: a demon.Bad deals no other company could have ever gotten through, political policies thrust at the population to further their status. Dirty, dirty money followed by regulation to stop competition.  An evil giant hell bent on consuming the planet. Amazon for me now is a love lost.  I can't hate them because I remember when I held them so dearly.  But they are a force so powerful and so dangerous that unless tamed, they have the potential to destroy the world.","May 17, 2020"

The rest of it their feedback is a scam iv had a few items that were appalling shockingly one or two amazon choice , which you think is the best choice wrong , not only did I order a eyelash kit that completely took half my eyelash away burned the area around my eye .. contacted amazon to them telling me to contact the seller hey ho no reply . I left my review exactly what happened funnily it doesn’t appear on the app .. to have e mail stating they sometimes put your reviews on the sellers selling page , and hey ho two days later the item no longer available .. then I order a uv lamp for my nails 72 watt my previous one was 48 which I found good . But this claimed to cure your nails in ten seconds and it didn’t took roughly three minutes per nail .. my previous lamp 60 seconds max .. so again put my review on amazon to it again not appearing on the selling page i review it on .. and this is happened to another item I bought last year but wasn’t aware untill I noticed the pattern of what happens should you leave a bad review .. this is not confidence buying as when you look for a item you look at the reviews .

I have been an Amazon Prime member for a couple of years now. I have always loved this company and web site.., and then came covid-19!!! I am not complaining about the slower (much slower) shipping... we all have to adjust to aid each other. What I am talking about is their product line & what they have aided Chinese companies in doing. For instance: I wanted to find “hand sanitizer.”  If you go to the other well-known ‘brick and mortar’ sites you will find it marked, “Out of stock” and there will be no “cheap” substitutes. Amazon owes it to their customers to maintain some quality control. Instead they are stocking many, very many substitutes that did not exist before. Also, they have allowed the price on “junk” to go through the roof. Read the review, the comments on these outrageously priced & newly appearing Chinese made hand sanitizers. It is absolutely nothing but a rip-off. Amazon should start listing items as “sold out” & stop aiding these companies with no quality control in flooding our markets with overpriced garbage. It is Amazon’s good name that will suffer. We expect Amazon to do at least a little policing of the products they sell, and prices that have quadrupled in a month’s time. I hope the Amazon name will mean as much “post” covid-19 as it did “pre” covid-19!!!","May 14, 2020"

I'm sure Amazon and Wish k ow that some of their stores are scam stores and dont care because they make their money either way. for example... I tried to leave a review for a product I didn't buy, but knew the store involved was scamming people. I'm good for leaving reviews for people to beware of scams. so, I couldn't leave a review because amazon wouldnt let me unless I bought the product. which leads me to believe that they k ow the product involved is a scam. regardless, you should be able to leave reviews for products you know these stores are buying from china and arent what they say they are or purchasing on wish and resealing them on amazon for a ridiculous price. like the $999.99 project runway brother sewing machine that one store is trying to sell as a collection item. when you can still buy this machine on breather website or anywhere else for anywhere from $150- $199. but amazon is letting this store sell this product, that let's be honest, isn't the best of brother for way over the price. What because of the kick back they recieve. I expect this from wish. we all know that wish that wish sell out of china mostly and what they sell are fakes and them some. but for amazon to allow this to happen is a disgrace. we all know wish dont vet their stores but for amazon to not vet theirs is unelectable.  this is supposed to be a Un koi ted states marketing establishment not some off country platform like wish. so we demand better pricing and equality from amazon. that's all I have to say Amazon stop screwing your own people & Stop allowing g scam store like wish allow into your platform.","May 10, 2020"

Their drivers have, on several occasions, indicated that a package was delivered, even going so far as to take a picture, only to discover they lied about having made the delivery. I have gone through the very painful process of contacting them, only to get no resolution. The most recent incident began April 14, 2020. I ordered birthday gifts for my great grandson in Houston area, whose birthday was May 6, 2020. Amazon indicated the package (with picture) was delivered on April 17, 2020. I ordered birthday gifts early because I was unsure how fast deliveries could be made during Covid-19. Some items were delivered on 4/17/20, but my granddaughter just told me today that one large package didn't arrive until YESTERDAY, May 6th, on his actual birthday. I discovered this today when I called my granddaughter to ask how Jasai's 2nd birthday went and if he liked his gifts. That's when I was told the driver knocked on her door to give her the package.You might say, ""Well done! It arrived ON his birthday!"" However, as I have said to Amazon customer service, when the drivers lie about when packages are delivered, it could create a problem if the item was NEVER delivered. It has happened to me recently, with the USPS. Amazon indicated that the item was delivered and yet my friend in Chicago has yet to receive the item. Dealing with the postal service is just as infuriating as dealing with Amazon's customer service. Your package never arrives and your are out of the price of your purchases. Amazon seems to go out of their way to make it near impossible to get customer service. I'm writing here because when I attempted to chat with Amazon's customer service, I was switched to something called Just Answer. For the price of a dollar (which they claim is refunded) you then wait for the system to match you with a lawyer (yes, that's right, a lawyer!) who will then call you or email you the answer to your question.Has anyone any advice on how I can do an end run around the Amazon obstacle course. I've tried their chat, they no longer answer their phones, I'm at a loss.","May 08, 2020"

I am overall satisfied with its services. However, when I share my reviews, only the positive ones get posted. Also, lately, as much as l would like to be understanding of the special circumstances of the pandemic and the confusion it has created, i find myself more inconvenienced than what it is reasonable, from my perspective. When ordering supplies; whether because of unavailability of it, or at times showing available items on the site, yet not been able to order them. For one reason or another not been able to place items in the ""cart."" I have tried to reach customer service to place the order, when in real need of an item. Customer Service has had a recording which states it is also unavailable? Is there something going on I am not getting? I wish I could stick to this site...but it's been kind of challenging to do so. Hope it can improve and that it is just a temporary situation. Thanks. Denise.","May 07, 2020"

They wouldn't arrive on time, something would be missing, or it would end up at the house across the street. So after all this time I decided ok well maybe my order will be fine. I was aware I would be waiting about 2 weeks. No problem there. Originally my order was set to arrive May 6. Ok cool. My issue is that the tracking status changed (it updated on Saturday) to it would arrive today on Tuesday, May 5 by 8:00. One of my items was damaged so they sent it back. Cool we figured that one out. But they said my other items are arriving on time. I contacted customer service today to make sure my items were arriving today. They said they will arrive tomorrow since they haven't shipped yet. Tracking told me otherwise. It's only a day off and the original date was for May 6 but why would tracking change if it didn't even ship yet? I told Karesh to let the boss know tracking changes just because then. Usually when tracking is updated it's because a change has occurred right? Then I asked why they weren't taking phone calls because the chat takes forever. Speaking is usually quicker. It would make more sense to just speak to someone. Karesh decided to copy and paste the message that popped up when you initially sign on to chat. I told him/her maybe not be a di*k. I know what the message said and I wanted to know why the corona virus stopped them from talking on the phone which is easier than the chat. Anyway, I will go back to not ordering from Amazon. Maybe I'll wait another 3 years to see if anything changes.","May 05, 2020"

Living in a very rural area, this is a life changer, and I go out of my way to support Amazon, after supporting my local small businesses when possible, for providing the level of service and customer support that they do!Keep up the good work Amazon!","April 22, 2020"

It’s not flawless and the are clear and obvious flaws. However take away those flaws and you get a very solid and reasonable company. Lots of availability. Great products but sometimes lets me down with the delivery. But overall it’s very good and trustworthy. If the a issue it’s always handled with professionalism and good integrity. Which I like.

Made me wait nearly 2 months for face masks I have been wearing them since beginning of March with disposable gloves and goggles when going out as they are helpful to helping prevent not entirely the risk of infection when going out. I understand things are difficult but these are priority items and should not be delayed. Luckily since Lockdown started I am not going out much only for food shopping as food shopping online is impossible. Usually very good having purchased face masks, a digital thermometer for my mother which came with a dead battery ( I had to change it) but it works fine for her now. And for a number of law books for me which they have normally been very good at delivery and the Flash Speed mop which I tried to get in stores but gave up and got it in Amazon. I do like Amazon but on one occasion items have been delivered to next door instead of our address and it's a good job they are honest neighbours. Good but could be better as my items are unnecessarily being delayed by up to a month now as a Prime customer with essential items they should not be delayed.","April 08, 2020"

Shipments taking average of 1.5 to 2 weeks to arrive unless patrons pay for next day service, which few can afford.  Items show available then go out of stock.  Their 'Smile' program is the most positive thing I can say.  I cancelled Amazon Prime due to constant problems.  Deliveries are left outside gate, on the street in a high traffic/theft area - doorbells aren't even rung. Deliveries are made to incorrect locations.  Customer service is overseas (866-216-1072; 888-280-3321) - ""0""Other:  Reviews aren't honest, cannot be believed.  Best to compare with similar platforms for factual ratings. Some reviewers are paid or given free products.  I was contacted at least a dozen times by a third party seller who wanted me to change my rating for a $15.00 item.  Final offer was $50.00 to change it.  I didn't.  More and more sales are being made through 2nd or 3rd party sellers, which Amazon assumes no responsibility for.  Had one experience where seller flatly lied and wouldn't refund for several unopened packages in one return.  Knew from tracking he'd received it.  Customers suffer losses that way.  Also, I get e-mails trying to sell me things after searches on Amazon, particularly for books about certain subjects I've just searched for, like health and diets.  Am very private, few people have my e-mail.  Am positive Amazon is selling my private contact information, which I resent in this age of increased identity theft.  I will have less and less to do with them in the future - they cannot be trusted.","April 05, 2020"

I currently have Amazon Prime, but I'm considering getting rid of my Amazon account entirely! Their customer service so far sucks! I've never had issues with them in the past, but it's quite odd now, as they have caused new issues that shouldn't exist! I go on my phone one day to discover I've been somehow logged out of my Amazon account because my device (the same one I've had for three years) is no longer suddenly recognized. When I try logging back in, my password was not accepted. I use a total of 4 different passwords, the only possible four I use on any website and I've tried all four with no luck. I tried to create a new password, and I had to verify I wasn't a robot, verify my email, and verify the expiration date on my bank card. I did all of the above AND once they all failed, I gave my old bank card info instead in case Amazon had for whatever reason not kept my updates. After several attempts, Amazon still would not let me log in. I tried going to Customer service in their site, but it wouldn't let me go through unless I logged in (which was my issue in the first place), so I tried ""Help,"" which took me a little bit to find the option about account login issues, but once I found it, it told me I had to login to fix these issues. I tried looking on both ""Help"" and ""Customer Service"" for an email or phone number and not only did I not find anything, but it kept telling me I had to login. I reattempted my four passwords and even tried a few others that I could remember that I rarely ever use on any site, just to see if they'd work. Nothing. I even wondered if someone has hacked into my account, but if they have, it's clear that Amazon is not willing to help me or keep my money and account safe. Finally, Amazon has locked my account entirely/for good until I can meet their impossible requirements and it's only now, at last, that they have provided me with a phone number. I give two stars for the benefit of the doubt, since Amazon has never caused me trouble before and, in the past, I've always loved Amazon and would have given them five stars, but if after I call them, they are unable to help me and/or they don't fix their glitchy website, not only will this rating decrease to a one star (although, at that point, I'd wish I could give zero), but I will remove my account, Prime and all permanently and never buy from Amazon again. I am infuriated that my account could potentially be threatened by a hacker and that I can't fix the problem by a simple password change! They better fix this or I'll cause a riot!","March 11, 2020"

When asked what should I do to keep this from happening was first told to change my password did that went hm n was able to get right onto my prime without having to log in with new password next was told to remove CC did that but then started getting emails telling me to put one back on file or my acct will be closed...put a bogus one on then went in a WK later to place a order had to put my original cc back on to place my order less then a hour late more bogus charges on my acct. The CSRs don't speak proper English so IDT they understand what I'm asking when I say:"" what can I do to keep this from happening"" its getting really frustrating so I guess I'll jus be calling each time to get refunded when I have to put my original cc on file to place an order n get hit with charges I did not authorize.

I read that to mean it could arrive in a week, six weeks, two months. I called customer service to get a more specific delivery date; they said they didn't know. I was told to call back next week to see if they had more information. They would give me no information as to why there was a delay in delivery.

They promise delivery dates & provide you with useless tracking numbers that dont tell u where your packages are, only that their delayed. This is the third time I really counted on them to be on time because it was crucial my items arrived on time for various reasons. I was traveling and needed a new power cord to work remotely, my daughter needed her college text books for class, and this time, my cats were waiting for their food. I'm disabled and it's often very difficult for me to get around to do my shopping. The most recent offense today is my 24lb bag of cat food that stated on Amazon's website - ""arrives in 1 day"" was supposed to be delivered yesterday. It left Tampa at 4:30 pm yesterday, more than 24 hours ago, and Tampa is only an hour to my front door. Not only that, but the tracking number (Amazons own shipping service) after the Tampa entry only says ""delayed"". And no one can tell me where it is. Same M.O. third time. Not only that, but after you've wasted your time with the whole process, their big solution is to provide me with a refund and their customer service agents act like their doing me a favor! I'm just sick of it. It feels like Jeff Bezos is calling us all a bunch of suckers cuz our money is in his pockets and he doesnt have to be nice anymore. Weve already made him the rich - hes got nothing to lose now.","February 01, 2020"

The only way to ship the kindle out of AK is via 2 day air. I didn't know this, Amazon's system didn't know this, and Amazon's customer support doesn't really know this as I have repeatedly found out.So I printed out the label for the trade in and brought it over to UPS who instantly tell me ""you can't ship this out via UPS ground, there is no ground service out of here"". And that's where my troubles began.I get home I contact amazon customer support via chat because that has never failed me before when I need help. The first person doesn't understand English at all, I keep explaining my problem and they keep copy pasting the same exact thing over and over again. The second person sounds helpful, understands my problem and escalates me to Joel R. Joel R. tells me that this is an unusual situation and the system shouldn't accept trade ins from AK, I say okay fine how do I get this item to you? Joel tells me he'll be working with somebody and they will email me a new shipping label that works for leaving AK.Eleven days pass, nothing. I try Amazon chat again, Amazon chat isn't working, as in the chat support service is down so I have them call me. The first person sounds helpful and they tell me ship it out myself and they will refund me, and to email them the receipt for it. So I mail it off, it's expensive. I email the receipt to the exact email address that I confirmed later is the right email address, keep this in mind for later. Then I contact Amazon support and the person on the line tells me the exact opposite, they can't find the receipt and even with the tracking number they can't pay me back for it.Suffice it to say, this ticks me off a bit because again it wasn't cheap to ship that item out. The third guy on the phone does understand my problem and does give me a refund and you'd think I'd be done, the item is shipped off, they have the tracking information right?NOPE! I check back on my email and I've gotten one from Amazon that says ""You've written to an address that does not accept incoming direct e-mails, but we have provided links to help answer some common questions.""I try emailing them again, same problem. So I go to their chat, the guy says he has to escalate me to their specialist department and I'm finally reaching person #8 to try and make sure this trade in goes through. The emails didn't go through, it was the right email address that doesn't work, I have to read out the whole UPS tracking number to them over the phone, and they tell me the system should pick up that the package is from me and things SHOULD work out.That's where I am today, I have to wait and see if Amazon's system works or if I have to talk to a ninth person in my great quest to make sure a trade in goes through.I have never had to contact this many people who were either wrong, didn't understand English(granted only one), never contacted me back, or who may have outright lied to me, for one single anything. Throughout the entire experience even the people who perfectly understood English I got the impression that they didn't understand that I was doing a trade in for store credit and not a return for at least 2-3 of them.","January 28, 2020"

However, it is up to you to pack it up again and then deliver it to a place so it can be returned. If they can deliver it, then why can't they pick it up. Why should I have to go out and use my time to return the item that wasn't as advertised. I may as well have gone out in the first place to go and buy it. I would have got what I wanted, and had it much faster. I stopped shopping with Amazon a while back, but thought I would give them another try, never again.","January 23, 2020"

You can find pretty much anything you need on amazon materialist wise and shipping is generally very fast. The cons are that some of the companies through amazon reselling products can be sketchy and it can be concerning whether that product (lets say a beauty product) is legit manufactured by that company. The other issue is a little more philosophical I suppose but amazon has kind of become a monopoly and is putting a lot of smaller companies out of business.,"January 23, 2020"

I've never once had a problem with an item that Amazon did not correct including times when an item was lost or damage and Amazon had to give me more credit than I had paid so I could buy a new one. Word to the wise: Always Call to use Customer Service & be nice. You should hear some of the horror stories I've heard from customer service reps from Amazon. The person on the phone did not do anything to you personally so don't take out your grievance on them. Also, USA is called the melting pot for a reason; if you have a problem with your rep having an accent that's on your small mind. I live in NYC in a borough where 142 languages are spoken- the most in the world- guess what? Other people have accents. Get over it. I buy a LOT of items from Amazon Warehouse Deals and am usually happy, but if I'm not, Amazon will accept my return with no fuss.

They sent me an email telling me they shipped my package to the wrong place and said we are canceling your order and refunding your money in 3 to 5 days. Why not just fulfill the order and re ship? I called to get more info and they said they can’t because of policy, and I have to reorder. Problem is they won’t refund my money for 3-5 days. I asked them if they could ship it faster, than the free 3-7 day free shipping that was offered, since they lost it and they said no. I understand that the package is coming from a 3rd party vendor, but if they can offer 2day prime shipping for free, than why not 2 day free shipping since they lost it? Customer service was very dismissive of my complaint and not at all helpful in getting my package in a timely manner.I also was unable to find a place to add a customer review regarding Amazon.

However, their delivery drivers can be unreliable. Example, one product I ordered reported it was delivered to me two days ago but I didn’t receive it. Tracking showed it was delivered to entirely different city. When I called customer service, the product was no longer available. Then today, along with a box I ordered, was another residents order (3 boxes) which I had to a schlep through the complex to deliver to said neighbor (excuse me Amazon, not my job)!  Delivery drivers need to slow down and read the address labels carefully. Poor training on part of Amazon.","January 12, 2020"

Alongside this I ordered a few other items none of which I was in a hurry for. I received the email confirmation and opened it later that day to discover that it was not going to be delivered until Monday. After the party. I contacted amazon to ask why the item was advertised as being able to be delivered the next day when in fact it would take 3 days. No reasonable explanation could be offered. I was told that I should check every item prior to ordering on Amazon's web site to confirm whether the actual delivery date was the date stated in the item description or not.   Yeah right. We all have time for that. Used to really like amazon. Feeling a little dissapointed now. Going back to the high street and getting something else for the dissapointed boy.","January 11, 2020"

They've really come a very long way since their rather humble beginings in the mid 90s. I've lived in the Pacific Northwest my entire life so the fact that they launched in Washington state and recently relocated their headquarters to Seattle nets them a few extra brownie points with me lol. In all seriousness, their customer service team is hands down the best of any company I've dealt with in my life. I'm an Amazon Prime member who gets frequent deliveries, so any time UPS screws up, sends my package to the wrong city, delays it past my 2 day Prime shipping window, or just straight up loses it, all I have to do is send Amazon support a chat message and I get a reply almost instantly. They go out of their way and bend over backwards just to ensure that I have the best experience possible. Of course, let's be honest, their primary motivation is to keep me coming back as a customer. But their customer support staff is so incredibly compassionate that I truly believe they care about me as a human being, not just a profit opportunity. Around Christmas 2018 someone else's Amazon Prime package was mistakenly sent to me, and when I alerted the support team, they told me they trusted me so much that I could just keep the items, so I didn't have to go thru the trouble of returning them, and they would send the intended customer a replacement for free as well. In a time when the status quo is for corporations to treat customers like cattle ready to be milked for money, the fact that Amazon actively chooses to LOSE money for the sake of customer satisfaction, that's pretty awesome. They say their goal is to achieve the world's best customer service, and they are definitely on their way there!My only complaint (or rather, constructive criticism) is please consider allowing customers to choose which mail carrier they prefer. It's always a gamble whether I get USPS, FedEx or UPS since that's just the way the system works. But UPS is just so awful that I would much prefer to choose the other two if I could. Or perhaps consider investing in your own startup delivery service! You could even, let's say, partner with Uber and let people sign up to work as delivery drivers. Just a suggestion ;)","January 07, 2020"

Never had a problem when they were using 3rd party vendors (UPS, USPS).  My biggest complaint is that now  when you order, they give you a delivery date (usually w/in  day or two) and then the date gets changed (sometimes more than once).  Today, I was notified that my package was delivered, but it wasn't there.  When I contacted their ""chat assistant"", it stated that the package was delivered.  When I made the next choice that it didn't arrive, it immediately responded with some B.S. that the delivery must have been posted too soon, and that I should expect it 3 days from now!  WTH???  3 more days, Really???  Anti-Trust laws will catch up with Amazon at some point, and we will have choices for such services.  (In my lifetime - not sure).","January 04, 2020"

Prime is no longer the 'next day delivery' promised. In fact paying Prime is now rip off becaue deliveries are the same without paying for it. In effect its a wste of money.Prime offers other  benefits --so they say . Music .. theres a rotten selection and only there to force you into subscribing to their millions of songs library . Its cheaper and better to get Spotify and forget Amazon music altogether.  During this year the music selection has been reduced continually . Now its useless. Asking for a song gets the generic response 'Heres a  station you might find if your lucky what you are lookng for '  Generally you dont . so thats another waste of time.Linking Spotify to the Echo account used to be easy . Now they make it difficult to force you into the poor Amazon Music.Amazon Prime Videos . another free benefit!!!   It offers nothing more than a few old movies . Far better is available elsewhere. Netfilx is FAR superior and at the same subcription price . Amazon is no competitor.Finally the Echo units 'age' and become deaf. I have 4 ... YES FOUR , in different continents and they all suffer from the same deafness problem. In my opinion its an inbuilt planned problem designed to make you buy another later version.  Dirty business practice.I wouldnt buy another echo..ever. I recommend you dont either.Nor would I subscribe to Prime. tyhose who have already done so would be well advised to review any benefit . They like me and others will conclude theres no value and cancel for refund","December 31, 2019"

We contact amazon on the 21/12, 22/12, 23/12 and the 24/12. The call centre which amazon uses is unfortunately useless and do not help in the slightest, they blamed our bank stating there was an issue with the payment - even though we had ordered 1 other item at the same time which arrived on the 22/12, using the same card! In order to get our delivery we had to cancel the order and put the order back through, waiting for the pending transaction to go.. thankfully we spoke to a very pleasant employee at amazon who managed to locate us the parcel to be sent the same day.We thought this may have been a blip which is understandable.. until we purchased another item from amazon which was just under £120.00, to our surprise we recieved this delivery on the 29/12.. to open it up to receive a HAIR ROOT KIT? which would clearly be under £10.00!I called amazon again and after being kn the phone for 1 hours I was no further forward, the call centre does not show any empathy and feels pausing for 3 minutes after you have spoken, polite. If they are not pasuing for a while after speaking they will interrupt you.So on the 29/12 we had to send a few emails, thankfully the issue potentially has been sorted.. I mean we have been provided an exchange but have been provided a refund to put through yet another order.  A lady by the name of Lydia Dimitrova, decied to respond to our email on this occasion, apparently using a expression stating you are 'pised' of is unacceptable. I would never swear at somebody on the telephone rather than just stating the obvious - it seems their call centre does not understand how furious and frustrated people get when they receive a ROOT DYE KIT, rather than an item for £120! Lydia proceeded to advise they can terminate calls if staff feel threatened etc, I think this is absolutely disgusting that you are accusing myself of this! I feel amazon (lydia) is taking the light away from Amazon's cock up rather than holding their hands up that they have done wrong.Amazon continue to state as the item didnt come through their company they cannot exchange, as far as I am aware if something is being sold through a company, you order from the same company, the item is in amazon packaging and it was packed at an amazon warehouse then the negligence is on them!Once my last item has finally been delivered, I will be deleting my account and will never use amazon again.","December 30, 2019"

I've been extremely pleased up to 3 weeks ago. It seems that when they went to their own delivery system and started to promise 1 day deliveries, that the issues have happened. Several item have been lost in shipping.At least 1 of the items was bought and fulfilled by Amazon. 1st item got lost, I got a refund because item was no longer available,and ordered a similar item. 2nd item got lost. Called customer service which issued a re-shipping order which did nothing. After several more days I got on their help center.Went through 4 customer service people. At that point I was so disgusted that I told them I lost faith in the system. They recommend that I order from a different vendor at $10.00 more for the same item and that they would pay the expedited shipping. I told them that the $10.00 more was the expedited shipping cost and that I did not feel that I should pay for their problem. They said when I get my item, I should ask for a refund of the difference. We'll see how it works out.Later,I did order the other part and did contact them once I received it. I also copied and pasted from the previous chat that I had saved so it was per their instructions being fed back to them. They not only issued a refund but also refunded the whole amount of the purchase. I guess they knew I was upset. I think I'm back on track with them.","December 23, 2019"

Their prices are competitive, and after hundreds of orders, I have only had an issue with delivery once. I had returned an item once and it was the most pleasant returns process I have experienced. I had the item collected from my home without any issues.I did however find issues with what i assume is their Indian call centre. Upon having my delivery lost, I contacted the call centre. It had been during the 2017 black Friday sales so it was a little understandable that the items were missing. However, what i did find annoying is the customer service rep being unable to understand that a mere refund and repurchase is not ideal as I had purchased during a sale, and the prices had increased. After trying to ask for a re-delivery rather than a refund, and the rep not understanding why a refund and repurchase was not ideal, I agreed to the refund. after 10 days, i did not receive the refund, i call again and am told its sorted. Again no refund. On my subsequent call, I was lucky enough to be directed to what i believe is the Irish call centre. I had no issues with communication and had finally received my refund two days later. One thing i really like about calling Amazon is that they call back in a certain number of minutes rather than you having to stay on the line.Other than my less than pleasant refund experience, Amazon tend to be good with returns. I like to believe that the experience is a one off. Amazon have been very consistent and i'd recommend them to anyone.edit: i did forget to mention that they carried on my Amazon prime (student) even though I am certain I cancelled it. what was annoying is that they still kept around £7 even though I had cancelled it again a week after realising. I also don't like how they try to trick you into paying for delivery as it is the default option even after being eligible for free delivery. I find that it takes a long time for the app to load when you do select free delivery. the cynical side of me says that's intentional to make people frustrated and just pay for the delivery.I did get scammed by a seller once. I was refunded immediately by an automated system. I believe once a seller is found to be a scammer, any claims automatically refunds you.One last point.

I generally don't like mega companies but I haven't had any issues with Amazon in probably 15 years or more. Usually, large companies are plagued by horrible customer service, etc., but I've had nothing but a pleasant experience with Amazon. I really want to ""hate"" them like I ""hate"" most large companies because of their profits-over-everything-else ways, but I haven't had any bad experiences with them on a personal level as far as buying $hit from them. I don't really know what to say. I mean, I realize not everyone will have a positive experience with a company, especially with one that millions of people use, but I have nothing bad to say about Amazon on a personal level. Yeah, they are a big company and profits are their driving force, so I'm sure they do some shady $hit from time to time, not to mention they are pretty much destroying (if they haven't already) mom and pop outlets, but man, I can't say much negative about them. This really surprises me because I ""hate"" just about everything mainstream. I have decided to give them 4 stars instead of 5, only because I know deep down, they are still just a big ""nasty"" mega corp. But on a personal level and customer, they have never let me down.

After the failed attempts I lost it (like I said not my best quality and I’m not proud of it) but the very nice man dealing with me (Nico) remained calm and helped me. I appreciate that a LOT. I’m so very lucky to have gotten Nico and I hope he has a very happy holiday season and sees that I really do appreciate his patience!!","December 19, 2019"

I have entered 3 complaints for claims, attached photos and am still waiting on reimbursement.

DO not run off the driveway into my grass, do not run over my sprinkers. However, the problem is getting worse.

They all just tell you the same thing. My personal card was charged on my company's business account for Prime. So I called in and the rep told me he would refund my card and give me prime for free for the next year. Sounds nice, right? Next thing I know, the prime membership on the company is canceled! I call in and they say the rep promised me something they can't fulfill (she will send a message to his manager to make sure he knows this for the future.. gee thanks) and he also canceled my membership, but ""no worries"" you can just sign up again on the sign up page. So about the promise, I argued with the rep saying a company such as Amazon should stand behind what their reps, even if the rep made a mistake. We had it out for a few minutes until she said she can offer me a partial promotional credit to my account for compensation. It was almost the full amount so I consented. About the continued membership, ""no worries, just sign up from your end because we can't do it from our end."" Oh, but when I go to the sign up page, the price for business prime is now $179 and we were paying $119! Even after emailing and complaining that I got into this mess from a rep that made a bad mistake, it's not my fault that my membership was cancelled and if it hadn't been I would be still paying the lower rate, every rep who emails me just tells me the same thing: Our terms changed and we ""offer Business Prime Memberships for Business Account where the customers can simply make purchases and avail two-day free shipping. This completely for a free shipping purpose and the other benefits of prime will not be given."" Sounds like it should be cheaper, right? $60 more than standard prime for personal accounts. Not getting anywhere with Amazon and very frustrated with ""Earth's Most Customer-Centric Company.""**After calling back and asking to speak with a manager, I was able to sign up again for the business prime and he will refund me for the difference of $60 this one time.

There is not any other company that can come close to compare to.   I order weekly from amazon with my prime membership and a few times I have had delivery issues (which is out of their control once it leaves there distribution center). Not only did customer service respond and react quickly to resolve the issue they went above and beyond what is asked for (only to correct issue) but issued me a full refund which was not needed cause I still received the item 2 days later.   They are so helpful and nice.   I know they ship thousands of products a hr and not responsible for what happens once in fedex or ups hands but still make it right.   I choose to buy everything including household supplies from them some things are a tad bit more expensive but the delivery to my door makes up in price.   I love amazon and recommend them to everyone!!!!!PS.  Also love the jobs it has created in my area for my community from distribution center to drivers!

However, since they have rolled out their new extra charge music service, I cannot find a way to access the music streaming benefit that I have already paid for.  Every time I click on anything to do with music, it takes me to a page to sign up for their Amazon Music Unlimited at an additional charge.  Even when I click on something that says Amazon Music that says it is included with my Prime membership, it takes me to a page to sign up for the new service at an additional charge.  I feel like I should contact a lawyer and start a class action suit because there are millions of people who have sign ed up for Prime with the understanding that they can stream music with their membership, but Amazon is effectively removing the benefit that we have already paid for and trying to force us to sign up for their new service at an addition charge. This is fraud.","December 05, 2019"

Excellent professional site to shop from, you can easily find the products you are looking for. Many options available for each product, shopping is made very easy. Shipping is a little on the slower side unless you choose to go with Amazon prime.      My main pro for Amazon would be the way they continually strive to better themselves. Like with Amazon prime!

I received an email saying my parcel would arrive on Tuesday. I arranged my schedule to be in the house for arrival, although no approximate time was given. On the Monday I went out and only then did I receive another email saying my parcel would be delivered “today”. No use to me , as I had arranged my time to be in the house tomorrow at Amazon’s instruction. I noted on the tracker that it had been delivered.  When I arrived home I looked for the parcel - couldn’t find it anywhere.  A card through the door maybe? No such card. I then spent an age logging in and finding the process, which said to contact the courier but they hadn’t told me anywhere who my courier was from the exhaustive list.  Again I checked for a card but found nothing.  Then I pulled out the waste bins from across the road and there, absolutely soaked in the rain, was wedged my parcel. What a poor delivery service.  Many other companies have delivery off to a fine art but not Amazon.  The parcel is an electronic item for our grandson for Christmas, so they had better work!

Recently, I have been asked to give a One Time Password when I try to log in.  Problem is that the OTP is sent to my wife's cell phone number, which does not work when I am travelling. Can't get a second phone number-- which is clearly essential for joint accounts.  The only alternative is to send messages to my Kindle Devices but, after four calls to support, no one can tell me how to receive those messages. Have tried the famous Jeff (at) amazon.com email address but got a nonsense answer.  Sometimes, I'm told they are locking me out of my account for my own security!!

I’ve also ordered many of my own personal things through the site as well. From clothes, to toilet paper and even random items like a pineapple carver LOL. They have a large variety of items and various vendors to choose from. The only issue I’ve really ever had is they tend to lose my packages. I even have an Amazon hub at my apartment complex where they can drop off the package directly. It’s always frustrating when something doesn’t arrive on time or gets lost some way some how in transit. However, Amazon has always swooped right in to help save the day. Their customer service is awesome! I’m more of a pick up the phone type of gal. I like that one on one customer service (it must be the sales person in me) but Amazon does also offer a chat service where you can speak to a representative directly. I’ve had phone calls and chats with them but I’ve had instances before where I can’t leave my desk to make a phone call. Easily enough I’ve gotten right on the chat, let them know my package was missing and they have sent a new one right out to me. Easy peasy!

The way to maximize the reliability and ease of shopping with Amazon is to stick with Prime shipping. The are focused on giving the customer what they want so the returns, shipping, and costs are competitive. I don't only use Amazon though because they don't have stores and they don't carry some brands. The reason why only 4 stars is because 1) they aren't perfect and there are various third party sellers to deal with and 2) the trade off for cheap prices and fast shipping is that quality is sometimes sacrificed and they put a lot of people out of business. I know because I came from 2 industries where I saw first hand how they put people all across the country out of business. I saw first hand working with Amazon, with vendors, and with my own companies how they actively took out all types of companies in a supply chain. But that's how we get cheap prices. It comes at the cost of thousands if not millions of jobs lost.","November 04, 2019"

The Bluetooth took5 weeks to arrive, so Amazon refunded me my funds and the very next day,  my package arrived.  I immediately got in touch with Amazon to have them reverse the refund they gave me. Though I never received the Thanos Avengers Action Figure I ordered,  one thing gave me so much more respect for Amazon as a company.  I ordered a set of security alarms and though the alarms were malfunctioned,  the person (s) that sales the Alarms through Amazon wanted me to give them a better review than the one(1) Star I gave them, which should have been zero(0), but I was unable to give that rating.  Even after I received my refund,  the person (s) continually texted me,  trying to pressure me into giving them a better rating which goes against my moral code and upbringing.  Amazon received my message of complaint about this issue and handled it themselves and I never received another text nor phone call from them since. Knowing that Amazon cares enough for their customers to push forward and handle situations such as this, let's me know as a valued customer that they really and truthfully put us the consumer first and will go above and beyond to make sure that we are satisfied with the service Amazon supplies to the public on a daily basis.","October 29, 2019"

Never had an issue. I became a prime member a couple months ago so I could “Subscribe and Save” to baby products. Who doesn’t love an extra 20% off diapers? Anyway I happened to come across a major steal on some diapers for my kids in store. So I canceled my “Subscribe and Save” for the following months since the deal I received was going to last a while. I was double charged for my subscription but that was immediately fixed then charged a third time for the canceled subscription. No biggie, I use the chat feature to speak with customer service and this is why I didn’t give 5 stars. The first representative I chatted with was rude and didn’t seem to understand what I was saying at all. I was simply asking for a refund for the charge but the CSR insisted there was no charge because Amazon doesn’t charge until the product ships and since I had canceled my subscription nothing shipped. Okaaaaay. I was looking at my account the entire time I was chatting with the CSR and clearly saw the charge on my account. All I wanted to know was when I could expect the refund but the agent insisted I wasn’t charged because there’s no charge until an item ships. The whole time he came across as very rude. Yes I know it’s via chat but there’s ways to word stuff to make it seem polite. I contacted my bank who confirmed they did charge my account and the money was out of the account.I contacted Amazon again via chat and the next CSR I spoke with was a lot nicer and was more willing to help resolve my issue. She gave me a turnaround time for when to expect the refund and apologized for the inconvenience as it seemed to be a system error. I get people have bad days, and maybe the first CSR was, but as a CSR myself customer satisfaction is a top priority. That experience with him was the only reason I didn’t give 5 stars.","October 28, 2019"

Normally if I can I'll add it to my wishlist and combine it with a another purchase at another time just so that I can get free shipping.

Amazon has search results so cluttered up with paid ads that do not meet the criteria that it is very easy to order the wrong thing especially when you're doing something where there is a specification and substitutes don't work. Also, it's just exasperating to be shown lots of things you don't want when you have specified what you do want.  Walmart has always had the advantage of being able to return things in store. Amazon seem to be addressing it but the method of doing the return fluctuates from purchase to purchase. So I was very unhappy to find out I needed to drive to the far side of town to return my item. When I called asking how I could modify it to other far side of town where I would be driving anyway since there was nothing near my house the Amazon help people, normally very good, had no clue what was going on. To Amazon's credit, they will literally credit me for the cost of returning it to UPS but it is going to require yet another call to Amazon to confirm that I returned the item. It is all based on a note in my customer service record. But it is easier and more straightforward to just order for Walmart. From a list of items filtered by my search criteria. Delivered to my house and returnable en route to my daughter's school. And often Walmart has better prices.  Their prices are real ones since The item has to be offered in an actual store with a price on the shelf whereas on Amazon Sellers list some absurd ""Original"" price to get our expectations set high and then show a discount which is usually not as low as the normal retail price. Ugh.","October 26, 2019"

Also, if you ever have an issue with fraud (my card was hacked and the criminal purchased two Prime memberships) then getting it resolved is a NIGHTMARE.

There have been some times where I have gotten an item only to find out it wasn't what I thought it would be, or wasn't as high quality as it should be, but Amazon makes returning an item really easy, so it's not much of a risk.  Prime is a great deal, considering you get free one to two day shipping on the vast majority of items they sell, PLUS you get access to Amazon Prime Video (and Amazon Music, although I have never used it).

Their two-day delivery was spot on, and I could order anything and trust the product.  Now, it feels like I’m always trying to check with myself as to why I’m paying this membership!  Two-day delivery is bs.  I’ve had several two-day delivery packages be delayed.  One was a birthday present for my 6 year old nephew.  We postponed leaving until the next morning because Amazon said the delivery would be there in two days.  Right at the 9pm end of day delivery mark, Amazon sends a shipment delay note saying it may not be for another 5 days.  The tracking showed it was in my city.  Why would that take 5 days?!  Im beginning to wonder what I pay this membership for.  The two day shipping has gone to the wayside, and I’m beginning to not believe in Amazon’s promise any more...or the quality of the products sold.  Don’t say you can do something if you can’t.

This area is lacking and may be something they should reconsider in the future. While this was only a $10 purchase, it gives me pause before larger purchases in the future; considering that there could be a change in price that they will not work around.

To be frank, I don't trust them anymore and I am extremely cautious about ordering anything from them for several reasons.  I mainly use my shopping cart as a shopping list these days and buy directly from the retailer as often as possible.Like the review below, I too had an order that was supposed to be delivered today but when I went to my orders to check on it, it said ""We're having trouble delivering your package to the address provided.""  Really?  It's the same address as always and they obviously know it's my package because they put a notification on the order.  I never received any email notifying me that there was a problem.  The bummer is that I needed one of the items today...c'est la vie.  But now my money is tied up with this order because it was part of a larger order that I used my Prime credit card for on a 6 month financing.  If they cancel this order and replace it, I will be forced to pay interest on the purchase as well as return ship the original order. So, as of this moment, they have my money and I have nothing..  Hmmmm sounds fishy to me. See, I always pay off my purchases before the promotional expiration and they don't like that.Yesterday:  What I'm about to share has happened a few times in the last 6 months.  I place an order and it arrives only for me to discover that I received more than one of an item that I ordered and yes, they charged me for more than one.  Yesterday I received 3 sets of bed sheets!!!- a whopping 150 dollars!  I only ordered one.  Again, my money is tied up for a few days and my credit promotion will be changed and I'll have to pay interest on the purchases. So beware and make absolutely certain to check your orders immediately after placing them to be sure of the quantities.  It would be wise to print that page.So, my point is that if you do have a Prime credit account, beware that if they have to cancel and replace any part of an order, you could lose your promotional interest free period. Another warning:  I'm particularly careful to choose a seller to purchase from.  I don't just let amazon choose for me.  There are so many fakes, counterfeit items, etc.. that I have to be very careful which seller to choose.  However, because of the FBA program ( fulfilled by amazon), many items get commingled with other seller's inventory in the warehouses and they don't let you know this.   Even though the seller I choose gets paid, the items may not have originated from that seller. Unfortunately, I've learned the hard way and this is why I try to purchase directly from sellers on their websites. If I were a seller, I'd be super ticked about this.  I've also noticed that even as picky as I am about choosing sellers, I've had items suddenly appear in My Orders to ship from China. China?  I would never order anything directly from China!  Not only is this not the seller I wanted but the item then takes over a month to receive.Amazon has turned into a dysfunctional jungle. Another thing I will complain about is that their Amazon delivery drivers can be tracked on a map.  I think this is terribly unsafe for the drivers and they need to stop that practice immediately.UPDATE:  Yesterday I called customer service/logistics about my undeliverable package. They told me that the package was sent to the wrong carrier and that the package would be sent to the correct one and delivered to me and to be patient and wait.   Last night I received an update saying the package would be delivered today- one day late.  I was so relieved!  This morning  I go to amazon.com to check on the order and it's now being refunded ONCE THEY RECEIVE the package. They don't specify why the order is being returned to amazon.  I received NO email telling me this.  This has me super angry because they should have immediately replaced the order and had it shipped overnight.  As it is, I have to wait for my refund before I can replace the items. Even though both items are fulfilled by amazon and both are Prime, only one of them would even be considered for an immediate refund and replacement because the other one is sold by a third party. Third party? It must be another FBA seller which is another reason to avoid shopping amazon.  It's just too complicated anymore.   Ordering from amazon is supposed to be a convenience but it's become a serious inconvenience.","September 21, 2019"

A once reliable delivery service for quality products at reasonable prices has become a complete crapshoot. Thanks to Amazon contracting out deliveries to 3rd tier courier services my packages routinely do not make it to my front door. Sometimes they are days late and often they never arrive at all. more and more products sold on Amazon are complete junk, often coming from China, and have no return or refund policies. Customer service, once a strongpoint for Amazon, has sadly taken a major turn for the worse. When I encounter problems and need to call I am almost always connected to someone at a call center outside of the United States. I am anything but xenophobic, but Amazon should not be employing  phone agents from Southeast Asia, who can barely speak or comprehend the english language. Amazon hires these employees at much lower wages as a cost cutting measure. This translates into poor customer service due to language barriers. The savings Amazon receives by outsourcing thousands of employees are used to reward stock holders, while loyal customers get deteriorating service, less reliable deliveries and crappier products. Given the tens of millions Amazon saves due to absurd corp tax breaks there is no excuse for any of their recent cuts in quality, reliability and service.Amazon needs to go back to hiring US based customer service agents  and pay them competitive wages. Amazon needs to go back to using UPS for deliveries rather than companies like Lasership, who are completely incompetent and uncaring. Amazon needs to have better system of quality control for the thousands of 3rd party sellers peddling products made of the lowest possible quality materials and craftsmanship.","September 19, 2019"

Once they moved to their contracted courier services (and fired FedEx and UPS) it has been nothing but issues regarding delivery, for which Amazon refuses to take responsibility (even though checkout literally 'Guarantees' delivery on a certain date).Packages will be mishandled, delayed for no reason, lost a lot more often than they used to be, or will supposedly be delivered without actually being delivered. And you quickly realize there's no actual guarantee from Amazon. Unless you initiate contact with them for an undelivered/unreceived package, you won't get a refund. Nor are they willing to offer anything to back-up the guarantee, such as an account credit, without the customer asking. And even then, it's $5, which is nothing especially if a large item is ordered.And try contacting Customer Service. You might as well be talking to a wall. They don't care. They all read off the same script and will keep you in ridiculous loop just so you get frustrated and quit your battle. They don't WANT the customer to be happy...they just want them to be frustrated enough to stop bothering them.The company just doesn't care about customers anymore. They are massive and their income in almost guaranteed, aside from millions deciding to boycott them. This will just get worse over time, and I think the company is going to be in trouble this holiday season. People just need to start taking stands against the company and start shopping elsewhere.","September 18, 2019"

In 99% of the time, they send a photo of proof of delivery. This is something others can't beat. Not to mention, they give timely updates, as well as arrive on time. I've had cases where they've arrived early. I assume it depends on where you live, but in my area, Amazon is gold.","September 17, 2019"

I ordered a play house for my granddaughters on Amazon . XPO Logistics was supposed to deliver it last Saturday. The drivers lied saying they knocked on the door. I waited all day thinking they were still coming. I received an email at 4 pm that night saying they tried to deliver but no one was home. I have two dogs that would have alerted me if someone was at the door.Then when I called to complain that they never tried to deliver the package the people on the phone where rude. Additionally, I found out they had my phone number wrong. I asked them to change it but I was told they couldn't change the number, I had to contact Amazon to have the number changed. The supervisor even refused to change the number or help me plus she was rude. ""You didn't see a big truck pull up in front of your house "". My bedroom are in the front of the house not my living area so how would I see them pull up to the house.I called Amazon and changed my number plus let them know I was unhappy with the delivery provider. Amazon changed my number in the system. By Wednesday I still had not received a call to deliver the playhouse. So I called to find out why. The lady on the phone was actually helpful. She explained they where calling the wrong number despite the notes in the system giving the correct phone number. She actually changed my number so the organization could contact me when they were delivering.Today I was given another 4 hour window. I called to try and find a smaller window explaining I have things I need to get done (the stuff I couldn't get done last weekend because I waited all day). Again the lady on the line was rude and unhelpful.If you order something and find that this company will be delivering it. I suggest you find the product somewhere else. I am not ordering anymore large items from Amazon if they are going to keep using this company. XPO Logistics  has horrible customer service!!!! Amazon has not done anything about this organization that they paired up with.","September 14, 2019"

In the past you could contact them, talk to a person and either get a replacement or sometimes they could contact the carrier to find and fix a mis-delivery.   Not possible anymore as far as I can tell,  I've spent the last 30 minutes trying to break through the Barrier - getting nowhere.  I am advised by robo-service that even though they've said it's delivered... it may take up to 36 hours for it to actually be delivered.

The first package shipped from 20 miles away and on the day it was supposed to be delivered it ended up in a warehouse in Kentucky, and this is bad because I live in Michigan. The second package was shipped from the same Brownstown, MI warehouse and now it's delayed in transit for 1-2 days.    I contacted Amazon's support team to assist and the first person blames it on a hurricane in Florida. Well that might work for the latest package if I were in Florida, but it doesn't explain the first package that was routed to a warehouse out of my state. I was offered a mere $5.00 for my wasted time. So I talked to a supposed manager, which kept going on and on about how sorry she was that my package hadn't arrived and said I should contact the shipping company. Which is AMZN no relation to Amazon. This is how I spent almost and hour of my evening after work.     So all said and done I got a whopping $10.00 credit on my account that can only be used on Amazon products. So I've wasted 3 hours of my time ordering/cancelling/reordering and contacting Amazon to get something delivered, which is roughly $3.33 per hour. I'm beginning to wonder if I'm paying $119 per year just to get jerked around.","September 05, 2019"

After giving up all hope, I conveyed my frustration in an email to the company’s founder, Jeff Bezos. Guess what? He took prompt action and the issue was resolved in a few hours! Sitting 7,400 miles away, in Seattle, he achieved what employees sitting a few miles away from my residence could not! I now realize that this is the reason why Amazon is the best company in the world. When the senior-most management is as proactive as this, I now have no doubt as to why they are No. 1 and know that they will continue their unprecedented rise for a long, long time! I wish them the very best! Thank you, Jeff, once again! 25 years after your company was founded and now worth more than a trillion dollars, you are still empathetic and value an individual customer’s opinion! This shows that your fundamentals are solid and that you haven’t forgotten the most valuable asset that any business can possess - the customer.

I reorder my printer ink, I buy protein bars, vitamins, ... you get the point. I buy all sorts of things. I've never had anything stolen from me, and only one thing came ""damaged"" - it was a crack in a bluray case but the disc was fine. Plus I've been a member of Amazon Prime for over a year now, and I love it. I love the convenience of getting things shipped to me fast. (The Prime Movies that are included aren't all that impressive though.) I don't understand what everyone's problem with Amazon is. Even when I had to deal with their customer service a couple times, they were always pleasant & very helpful. My only gripe with Amazon is that it is frustrating that the price on some things change sometimes a few times a week (or in a day even), but usually with those, if I wait it out a day or two, I can catch the price just right.Personally I HATE Walmart - (seriously, WHY is the cocount water in the peanut butter aisle?) and for me, Amazon is a lifesaver.

They have shipped a few wrong orders, though I was able to get them replaced fairly easily, it was hours on the phone, and running in to mail a package back to them. The reason I ordered from Amazon with that purchase was that I needed it fast with the wrong order being sent twice was not able to use it. Then even more recently I have found that all the Amazon apps are kinda completely annoying. I used to have kindle, shopping, video and music apps. The problem is that when I tried to use my husband's account that has prime for the shopping app and my account for everything else, it would sign me out of all the apps on my phone. There seems to be no option to sign in with different accounts for different apps. Also my husband got a few months of kindle unlimited for free, and I have found that any book that I have shared with my husband he cannot read because they will not download. Extremely frustrating.","August 08, 2019"

When in Europe, I purchased several items from the Amazon's German branch amazon.de., and my experience is quite different. I bought an electric scooter, which was faulty in a very dangerous way - it kept folding down while riding, and I kept falling down. I requested returnining it, and receaved a string of empty promises. I wrote to the headquarters, got several apologies and was directed back to the seller who gave me another promise. After about a month, this is where I am now: silence and nowhere to write to.In the Amazon.de there seems to be a pattern of delays accompanied by the message ""This delay is highly unusual""  which allows the complaining process to pass the 14-day, expiring the return's deadline and the communication means.The consumer protection in Europe is generally very weak, and Amazon.de seems to operate within that atmosphere.

I have a plate in my neck at C5-C7, I have Peripheral Nerve Disorders. Because of the problems with my neck and spine, I have nerve damage in both feet. Anyway, after about two hours with the Vibrathotics on high, I turned them off because my feet were burning, because of the nerve damage. So, the next day when I woke up, I noticed that my feet felt great. No pins and needles or nails being hammered into my foot or ankle. However, as things go, the pain started to slowly come back throughout the day. So, I put my slippers on and wore them for another two or three hours, and the same thing happened again. I was pain free for hours, then the pain would slowly creep in and I would put my slippers back on. This seems to be the system that works for me, but it may be different for you. I hope my story helps you with your feet health.  I love my Vibrathotics.                                            THE END","July 24, 2019"

But recently, I decided to purchase shoes on Amazon and I had the most stressful experience. When I ordered my shoes, I kept tracking it and everything was going well and I liked how Amazon always tells you when your shipment will arrive. On the day my shipment was suppose to arrive, i checked my tracking information and it said it was being sent back to seller with no explanation. When I reached out to the seller he explained to me he didn't know why either and that id receive a refud. I was very annoyed and confused but I gave amazon another chance because like I said before, I have had good experiences with Amazon. So I decided to just purchase the same shoes from another seller on Amazon and when I did everything was going well until on the day the shipment was suppose to arrive AGAIN. On this day, I logged on to check my tracking info and it said UPS was unable to deliver my package. I contacted an Amazon Agent and they told me that my address was incomplete and I needed to contact UPS to complete it. Mind you my product was delivered and at a UPS near me. When I contacted UPS to complete my address they told me that it was a huge change of address if I completed it,So UPS told me to contact Amazon to complete the address. when I spoke to another Amazon Agent they said they couldn't complete my address either because the carrier had the product. At this point I'm calling UPS and Amazon back and forth to complete my address and no one can do it. Finally UPS told me I could pick it up at the UPS ware house but I needed an ID. And I couldn't pick it up because I always use a Nickname online shopping. If Amazon could have told me my address was incomplete as soon as I purchased my product, I would not have gone through all of this. That was the most stressful online experience I've ever had at that point I just canceled my order.","July 24, 2019"

I placed multiple orders from Amazon on prime day. Most of the items I purchased depended on receiving all of the components for everything to work. I was anticipating receiving all of the shipments on the days as indicated in my account. Of course everything did not arrive as Amazon said they would. I never received any form of notice of about there being an issue. Just by chance I went on my Amazon account to check on a more recent order to realize that supposedly there was an issue with some of the items. Supposedly these items where lost in shipment go figure. I called customer support and surprise I was told that these particular items would to be available for reshipment until August. No offer to compensate for my inconvenience. This did not make me happy because we had already scheduled someone to be at our home to install of the things that were ordered. Then again today I go onto my account to check some more orders that were placed after prime day and I see one of my orders that previously indicated was shipped there was a notice about being an issue and if I did not contact Amazon by a certain day the order would be canceled. Of course I did not receive any form of notification. I again called Amazon to be told that the item was not in stock and they can not even tell me when the item would be available to even be shipped. I made a comment to the customer service rep that is wrong for Amazon to over sale items and not even let a person know this when the original order was placed. This is such an unfair way to do business. I have been told well your credit card is not charged until the item is actually shipped  like that makes me feel better that I have things that I have to hang onto in hopes that I will get everything and it will not be to late to return the things I will not be able to use if I do not get everything. This is my rant for the day,"July 24, 2019"

A bazillion dollar company doesn't need little guy reviews. It will not make or break them at all.  When something is horrible, we all race to our puters to leave BAD reviews, I know, I am one of those people and I call em like I see em! FAST.  But when something is good, we often forget to give those shout outs.Amazon might as well be a family member for as often as I am ordering things and boxes showing up at my door.  Little things, BIG THINGS, VERY high dollar things, lots of low to mid dollar things, household things, and even food.Have I had counterfeit items. YES.  I have a have items not arrive, rarely but yes!  Have I gotten broken items, you betcha?  Have I gotten items not nearly as described! Uh huh.  Not that often but every single time I contacted customer service via chat for starters.  At first I would always get someone in India or the phillipines and I was thinking to myself ....oh Lawd, here we go, they are not going to understand me the loud-mouthed American, this will not have a happy ending, etc.  BOY WAS I WRONG and quick to misjudge.  These people are SO NICE and the way customer service SHOULD be!  They always, and usually through chat only, resolve whatever my problem is, be it a replacement, a refund and I REALLY feel that their apologies are sincere.(and I am cynical too)  In one case I did have to go through 3 reps to get resolution but that was the only time.  I have also spoken to their customer service on the phone and again, no matter who I speak to, no matter their race or country-problem gets resolved-FAST.I also am an online shopper of many other places.  Think along the lines of HSN, WALMART, CHEWY etc.  If I have a problem with one of those places, OMG its a hair pulling NIGHTMARE to get it fixed, be it a replacement or refund.So IMHO and from my years of experience with Amazon, I want to say THANK YOU for having the BEST CUSTOMER SERVICE on the PLANET!  Other companies need to learn from you.","July 02, 2019"

No notifications received so checked the tracking and delivery company state damaged in transit and returned to sender. I then had to contact Amazon myself to get the issue resolved. Called just after 8am this morning, call handler said she needed more time to look into it and would call back within 15 mins. I got sick of waiting so used live chat, not very customer friendly either so asked them to cancel the order in full and refund me as only option given was to reorder the item and then they would refund when original was returned to them by the courier, I of course wasn’t happy laying out the money again. They offered a £5 credit to my account as a gesture of goodwill but I really don’t think this is good enough, taking into account the amount of time I have wasted today contacting them and also the inconvenience of now having to source the item elsewhere and also having to wait for my refund.

They really need to be more honest about there shipping practices, the ONLY thing the “prime” membership saves you is the $20.00 shipping cost.

However, I became an Amazon Prime member in 2014, and at that point, I started ordering all the time, multiple packages a week, of stuff for myself, my kids, my husband, etc, and started using the same day delivery service all the time. I don't know if there's anywhere that numbers are complied, but I can safely say that I ordered over 100 items through same day delivery, split into dozens of orders. I have been so impressed with Amazon and their ability to keep up with this. I had orders put in by noon, that arrived by 4pm that day, even though it says it will arrive by 9pm. With the thousands of orders they get every day, the reliability and efficiency is unbelievable. No system is perfect, but with the large amount of things I've ordered, I can think of maybe 2 or 3 times that something didn't show up on time, that came maybe a day or two later. This is even with the same day items.A couple years ago, I was staying at my Mom's house, and she lived in a neighborhood that was part of the Prime Now delivery area. I used the Prime Now 1 hour delivery service, and the two hour free delivery, and I made at least 30 of these orders, and never once were they late or incomplete. The selection is limited, as are the delivery areas, but the variety of things they can deliver to your door are really impressive. I've had groceries, household items, sweatpants, t-shirts, work pants and socks for my husband, toiletries, rain boots and various clothes for my kids, cleaning supplies, gifts, etc, all delivered within less than an hour. I now live in the suburbs, out of the Prime Now area, but I still use the same day delivery. The free delivery, even with a short window of two days, isn't something you find everywhere.Nothing is perfect, but the reliability of my deliveries, and the accuracy and good condition of the items, has been about 98%, in the many years, and many, MANY orders. I see a lot of complaints about Amazon, and I just wanted to put in my experience, as some of the complaints are from people who have only used Amazon a couple times, and had a later arrival, or a problem with their order, which is unfortunate, but in a huge operation, there are bound to be flaws, but overall, they offer a service which was previously not available. Also, I get frustrated when I see complaints directed at Amazon, when the order was through a third party, and the both the product and delivery were through another supplier, but the person ordering it didn't even bother to pay attention to this.Bottom line, I'm appreciative of Amazon, and they have definitely been useful to me, and I've gotten my Prime membership fee back many times over, with as many times as I've used the same day, one day, and two day free delivery.","June 30, 2019"

The only thing I wouldn’t recommend getting from amazon is clothing as it never seems to be as described on the website. But for electronics and media it’s excellent. My most recent order was the Arnold Schwarzenegger movie “Commando” on Blu-Ray which was less than $10 and had one day shipping. Amazon Prime has really good shipping times but when it comes to one day shipping in the past it would usually come the day after the expected delivery date, but it was actually correct this time. It can be very questionable sometimes how amazon is able to ship their items so quickly.","June 29, 2019"

It was set to be delivered today by 9PM. It is almost 8. Around 7 I was able to track the vehicle headed my way, several miles out. I went outside since I live in a townhouse and even though one gate was open due to an open house in another unit, I stood out front looking out for the driver. A message popped up saying I was next. No problem since I was already outside WAITING and WAITING. About a minute later, I received a message saying that the driver had been unable to deliver my package due to lack of access to my residence. That was a total lie. I called the cust sac number and got a nice customer service person in a foreign country. She attempted to be as helpful as she could but there was confusion about the order status. If the not so honest driver was still in the neighborhood, could he just return and do what he was supposed to do in the first place...actually attempt the delivery? They claim they have no communication with the driver who NEVER ever attempted delivery. The rep. stated that I MAY get it the next day and if not they will reorder with one day delivery. I informed her that I am not going to mess up my Saturday waiting on a math book. Not an urgent item, but nonetheless a ridiculous waste of everyone's time and the driver is obviously a liar who is getting paid by customers to NOT do his job. In the future, I will have items delivered to a locker for smaller items.","June 29, 2019"

Now with the usual mis delivered items but In the last year it has been getting worse.Now they have this new thing when they deliver your package they send you a picture of your back porch. Trouble is, it's not always your porch. I have pointed this out several times but they'd rather shine you On with an obligatory sorry and a couple of bucks. Not to mention you pay an additional $119. for Prime -  1 to 2 day shipping . This week I ordered And promised my 5 yr. Old granddaughter a Dodger hat, glove, and 2 balls by Wednesday. Wrong. Wrong porch. Told them and said send driver lbackout to get and redilever. Nope, too easy, will resend. Another two days. Hat came in mail, thank goodness. Promised my granddaughter a Dodger hat n ball to help make up for it. Supposed to get Friday. Wrong again. Same porch, not mine. Sent text as soon as I got the picture and quite aggravated now with a crying granddaughter i immediately send a text to send driver back out now and pick up my items and deliver to me. That didn't happen. Next day I find the obligatory sorry again. Was quite upset by now and have to take nitroglycerin tabs for the chest pains they created and let them know it too. So needless to say, no reply, no baseball no bat and no resolution. Could that driver live there or know someone there?? Does that person need glasses??? I'm my opinion Amazon condones the theft of packages not belonging to addresses not to mention opening other people's mail. Found out open someone's mail from your mailbox. It's a federal pffense. You give it back. I guess when you get that big you can treat common people however you want. They should remember when they weren't so big and who helped them get there. I'm a big Dodger can having been born in NYC. First game I went to and only games were Brooklyn Dodgers. Now we carry the torch for LA Dodgers. This is so disappointing how they treat people. Thank you Trustpilot, for listening.  And here it is Monday and you guessed it. No bat, no ball no response,no consideration for the consumer. Why would you think I ordered that. To see someone else get it. So much for 20 + years in the military. My husband fought in Korean war and two tours in Vietnam and he can't even get our 5/6 year old granddaughter some Dodger stuff.

I tried dealing with the customer service reps to resolve with no success, so I filed a fraud alert on my credit card. Since then this has happened twice more, Yesterday I chatted online with the customer service rep who informed me there was nothing they could do to stop these unwanted transactions. After 39 minutes of trying to reason with them that there must be a way to stop it, I realized I must be now part of Rod Sterling's program, The Twilight Zone. In frustration I called the credit card company and cancelled the card since as long as they had the number on file they just kept adding the gift reloads for $100 and then sending two $50 play stations which depleted my gift card which they then reloaded which created another order for pay stations. After cancelling the card they informed me I needed to contact them with new credit information. Really?

The second item was sold by Amazon and Amazon does not support reviews of Amazon on their website. When I wrote a review of the product that included details about the product being used, not new, Amazon rejected the review.Amazon collecting and posting reviews of its sellers while not allowing reviews of itself is questionable at best.

But there are these aggravating issues: (1) Their auto packing tosses items into one huge box, frequently with insufficient packing materials, and I have had so many broken items I no longer order items such as prime pantry (2) Because they do put as much as possible in one box it is frequently too heavy for me to handle and is frequently put in front of my door so I cannot open the door and have to walk around the house to move it to the other side, which any sensible delivery person would realize (3) Amazon's newer delivery service that I guess is avoid using the post office involves a number of different carriers, some of which are so poor that I have to call customer service...once because an item was just tossed into a snow bank on my driveway, another when it was tossed onto a dark driveway where it was smashed, or I suddenly got a notice that no one was there to accept the package and I NEVER changed from unattended package instructions (4) sometimes the delivery person leaves the package at my back door, where it does not occur to me to search for packages, so sometimes it is there for a few days before I realize it was delivered (5)when you are expected to say why you are returning an item you get a list of options that for me have seldom included any item connected with why I am returning it so I just mark off any one of them and hope for the best (5) if you ever get an email address or phone no. for Amazon customer service cling onto it because if you try to get that by an inquiry on the Amazon search you will never find it there.

Their website usually loads quickly and their apps haven't given me many problems. Their prices are often the lowest and I really like that the active and prominent review system helps keep the sellers from abusing customers too much -- without warning, anyway. As for sellers, they could stand to mark down some of their seller fees.One of the best things that Amazon has done is to empower aspiring authors with Kindle Direct Publishing -- independent publishing has taken off largely because of Amazon's KDP and Audible. This is really good, especially for young, tech savvy writers who get turned down by traditional publishers for whatever reason.","May 23, 2019"

Unlike UPS or FEDEX, who assign you the same driver week-in, week-out, Amazon seems to be assigning pure duffers who have no experience in delivery. Instead of leaving my packages where I want (outside or inside my garage door), they might dump a 40lb. package onto the day lilies surrounding my mail post—on the curb, 50 yards from my home—or on my back patio, or at my laundry room door, BECAUSE AMAZON HAS NO SYSTEM FOR ME TO REQUEST A PREFERENCE! It’s amateur night whenever they deliver! Their people don’t know me, I don’t know them, and they have ruined a number of my deliveries by leaving them out in the rain without so much as a plastic wrapper for protection.

This is frustrating because I got this just so that it could be sleeveless. If there was a smaller sized top, it would probably be perfect for me. ALSO- the main reason for the 1 star, other than the top fitting so poorly, is that on the adhesive liner on the bottoms (which had been somewhat peeling upward by the time I got them), there was a... I hate to say this, because this is so utterly disgusting, but there was a pubic hair stuck to it. Listen, I get that other people need to try these bikinis on to see if they fit, but that’s just revolting.

Customer services was unable to understand my problem with a seller.  The seller had missold a piece of furniture (a bed) as it was not the measurements stated.  As it was missold the seller should have dealt with the issue.  Amazon's response was that the seller was dealing with it as they had agreed I could post it back and would refund me when they received it.  If I had to post a missold bed back to the seller at my own expense and have the postage recorded it would cost me a fortune and I would not even know where to begin returning a bed by post!  They were not taking into account that it was missold and just kept telling me to return the bed.  Also, the customer service person referred to me by my last name without using Ms or Mrs, it felt very rude, and I corrected them but they didn't get why it was wrong.  Ultimately the issue was not resolved and I decided that the whole reason I liked amazon was because I trusted them to resolve issues.  I would be better off shopping directly with shops on line as I would have more rights and be able to deal with the issue more directly.  Amazon not only did not help but I have no way of directly contacting the seller as they only provide a no-response email when they send me any communication despite telling me in the email to call them.  I have decided to stop trying to get my money back through Amazon but I am taking the matter to Trading Standards.  In the meantime I have lost all trust in Amazon and will only now use them for small items that can be posted back and for Amazon Prime.  I do not trust them to deal with larger purchases.","April 27, 2019"

Far exceeding expectations and are worthy of all the business and publicity they receive in a positive atmosphere. They resolve problems quickly, respond by calling within a matter of minutes instead of a long wait time, have some of the lowest prices and their Prime 2-day shipping for free cannot be beat.  Returns are never a hassle as you just print out a label and go to USPS or UPS and the refund is given to you at that point rather than waiting for them to actually receive the item.  I know of no other company online that comes close to this type of additional incentives that promote a feeling of well being and trust.","April 25, 2019"

Couldn't refund it back to my debit card, so I used a portion to purchase something else. Now I was told, since it wasn't the full amount, it will have to stay on the gift card and not able to go back to debit card.  I didn't choose it to be placed on gift card in the first place.

My reasons are simple and important to not buy back from Amazon:It is already several days that I am receiving text messages sent by B2C (Bar Group Services), the company designated by Amazon in Israel to deliver the purchases to Israeli buyers.The messages have a link for an interactive application that should facilitate delivery coordination, but ... it does not work, there is no interaction, it does not lead to any contact.Searching the internet, I found the single line of customer service ... and it does not work either! The client only hears the pre-recorded message about the service schedule, restricted to the service between 8am and 5pm during the work week and from 8am to 12m on Fridays. Even so, no one answers the client even within these very tight times: during the whole day the only thing the user hears is the pre-recorded message with the promise of returning his call to the number of which the client has communicated. When? It is not known, because nobody called me back. In summary, the transport company chosen by Amazon for Israeli buyers only has two telephone recordings: 1) Reminder of customer service hours; 2) The promise to return the call without referring to the deadline.Finishing: I buy in several platforms of different products and I enjoy them a lot, because I receive them quickly and in perfect conditions. But the same does not happen with Amazon products, because the delivery is long, tortuous and forces me to waste my time to move to remote and difficult locations, which were not stipulated in the billing of my purchase. Since the same products can be found on other E-Commerce platforms, why should I keep buying on Amazon?","April 13, 2019"

You even get discounts too, there was a product that my parents were gonna buy for $60, but with amazon prime the price went down to $20. Can you believe it?

It is still ridiculous for them to suggest that I do that......not to mention awkward!!!!  I will cancel my prime and start shopping on Walmart.com.

I am a Prime member. In February, some unauthorized person illegally accessed my Amazon account and used $349 of my gift card balance in three orders before I noticed it.  When I called Amazon, they assured me that an investigation would be made and the $349 would be returned to my gift card balance.  It has been five weeks and has taken over 10 calls to customer service so far.  Each person has been very nice and assured me that I would receive an email in 24-48 hours regarding the status of my account. I did receive the same email several times, but when I called, I was told that the $349 had not yet been returned to my account. Each person said that they would contact an expert to take care of the problem. It has not been corrected yet.  I would close my Amazon account and just open another one, but I am still out the $349 gift card balance that I was assured would be re-credited to my account.  In frustration, I even emailed Steve Bezos to see if he could get this resolved.  Its not right that I am having such a hassle with Amazon that had nothing to do with anything wrong that I did.

What an awesome experience!!  With a touch of a button you can access all your orders always arriving on time and in some cases before time. They stand by their return Policy even with the 3rd party sellers.Refunds are taken seriously and  a Customer never has to feel ripped off.  Now with the Lockers at mostly all 7/11 we have 24hr access how convenient. As for the reviews click on the 1 star verified buyer only button and read what they are saying compare it to the other starts do a ratio and you will find the correct balance as to the real value of a product.  From the time I started doing this I have not been disappointed once with a purchase.  I tried Walmart.com very disappointing.  Their 3rd Party vendors very dishonest lots of false advertising returns are difficult and you never get your money back on time or in full.  I have decided that if I can not find a product on Amazon then I will go without it or get an alternative because I have no trust in any other company to deliver to the customer on time and in safety.  You will never lose your money with Amazon,"March 06, 2019"

I dont mind waiting, if that's what the item I am buying states but if it says it will be here on a Tuesday then I expect it to be here on a Tuesday. I pay 100+ a year to have this service. 4 stops and 5 miles away from my home the driver decides to mark the package with ""attempted"" delivery. I called Amazon and filed a report and they could see the driver was no where near my residence at time of ""attempted"" scan. If you take on a job, do it, or you shouldn't get paid. This kind of misuse of Amazon's time and customer complaints will eventually end up in the consumer pocket since Amazon will lose money hiring lazy drivers.","February 27, 2019"

When someone sells something so bad, such as the quality of a CD film, how can you as a private buyer stop them from selling more junk to the public ?This type of sellers don´t want any ratings, so from there they are protected from further scam. When the item had been sold for a low price the you completely loose in the transaction as you don´t want to be involved in a return fight where you absolutely don´t know wher it will stop.

Orders are usually delivered quickly in 1-2 days maximum (with Prime) and you can return them (30 days policy) if there is anything wrong. Indeed, I have returned some items already (mainly clothes which were the wrong size for me) and I have always had my money back without further ado. Items quality is the same as if you were to buy them in store (obviously) and prices are quite competitive as well, most of the time.If you get Prime you will also receive many other benefits (free of charge), like Amazon Prime Video which could be used to watch TV Series and/or Films.UPDATE: I had some issues with the US website where I couldn’t place an order for anything using my UK credit card and had to buy a top up code from a third company to do so. They also randomly decided to remove my CC information, billing and delivery address thinking someone had access to my account... which is something that never happened. The US counterpart also doesn’t have a live chat service (while the UK one does instead) so you have to contact them by email to get an answer in writing, which is much less efficient.UPDATE 2: A few months ago, my Amazon account has been momentarily suspended as a result of moving home and a series of other “triggers” which made their system think someone else had been able to access my account. The issue itself is understandable, what it’s not instead is how this was handled. Indeed, I was never contacted by them about this so that I didn’t even notice there was an issue to begin with until I once tried to log into my account and couldn’t. Once I have realized something was off I then had to contact the Audible team (yes, Audible, not Amazon directly since I couldn’t have a live chat with them or send emails as my account was suspended) in order to get this fixed. The weirdest thing is that even they didn’t have a clue about what was going on (despite asking for my account details, thus having access to the relevant information from Amazon). I had to contact them multiple times and each time I was given a different story starting from “oh, sorry dead, your account has been permanently deleted, please open a new one” to eventually “we don’t know what the issue was but your account is now live again” 🤷🏻‍♂️. That was really a bad experience and required me several days (and chats) to fix. Maybe, instead of making such a mess, they could have just sent me an email asking to reset my password, or something like that, if they really just thought someone else had been able to access my account...","February 23, 2019"

Never really had any real problems, just a small glitch here and there and they have taken care of it.  But for the past month I have been extremely unhappy with their service.  It seemed like every order had a problem.  One that they said was delivered and put in a secured location wasn't and besides the fact we have cameras and my son was outside when they said it was delivered, the first customer service rep didn't believe me and had me checking with my neighbors to make sure they didn't get my package. Finally got him to understand that either my cameras in the front and my Ring doorbell there was no way they could have delivered it without my knowing.  They reordered the items, but some of them were out of stock so they ordered alternate items that were not the same at all.  Then one of the items was lost during transit.  Then the next order the wrong items were sent and then the big one.....we ordered a memory stone for my husband's grave.  It had a particular saying on it.  When it arrived it was totally different than what we ordered.  They sent me a label to send it back and ordered a replacement.   He said they would pick it up when they delivered the replacement. Two days later, it arrived, the same one that they sent in error the first time.  And they didn't pick up the wrong item from the first time.

Full story; Received a notice that they where unable to delivery because they couldn’t gain acces to my house...  called up CS to find out what’s going on and they said they try again the next day.  I told them they didn’t try at all because I have security cameras and no one showed up.  After being on hold for about 15 minutes (I pretty sure they put me on hold hoping I will hang up) they informed me that the package was lost in transit and they are sending a new one out.   I’m fairly confident that was a big lie they train their CS reps to do.  I than question her how it can go from unable to deliver than lost.  She said that the driver did a great incorrect scan which I believe is another lie.  I tried to call her out on that but she was from some other country and got very frustrated when something wasn’t to script and I was tired of trying to understand her.  Therefore I just accepted the new delivery.","February 14, 2019"

Since CHEVAUHN  helped me with cool temper and patient, I am glad. Now I am waiting for my money to be transferred to my account and waiting the return address from Oasis .  OASIS should put the return address on the return label. So it helps to save time both buyer and customer service.","January 28, 2019"

As I was about to turn around I noticed your driver reach up and drop something out the window. The wind was blowing and blew his trash into sight. I know you don’t have control over everything people do. However, maybe education on not littering and trashing up property people work hard to keep pleasant might help.","January 27, 2019"

Sadly, you don't get free delivery, you have to first spend $35 or more to get free 2 hour delivery. If not, they'll charge you $4.99 for delivery. Why can't it be free no matter the cost? Membership cost is ridiculous, but yet, it's not free or maybe $0.99.2) Prime Video app does not support 'Chromecast' so that we can cast shows and movies to TV's. We're expected to watch content on our phones but we can't control what we do, even though membership cost is ridiculous.","January 26, 2019"

It is also a problem that when you order something, you are given a deliery date and when it is shipped you are given the actual delivery date (and that it is coming from China). The problem with this is that you cannot cancel the order once it is shipped and returning it is nearly impossible. I have been tricked several times into ordering cheap knock offs (which most of the $ is for shipping, not the product) from China with fake reviews. If you use Amazon, only order prime. That is shipped directly from Amazons warehouse. Anything else is buyer beware (even from US third party sellers).","January 02, 2019"

I have done so to relate my experiences with companies, and I strive to stick to the facts. This is my third, and it is alarming. Today I posted a review about a defective watch that I received from a third party seller, but fulfilled by Amazon. I contacted Amazon and requested that I be allowed to return the item and that a refund be issued to me. Amazon co-operated but told me that they could not provide me with a return shipping label. That would have to come from the seller, who is in China. OH? OK. I asked how long would that take? Amazon stated that if the seller did not respond within 10 days, then Amazon would begin a claims investigation. I accepted this and gave it no further thought. Then, I took off the watch, which I had been wearing for 3 days. OH... MY... GOD! My wrist had a raw area where the watchband had been. I called the emergency room of my VA hospital and told them what was happening. They advised me to come in to have these marks examined and documented. I said I would do this tomorrow. But first, I got onto the Amazon product page, looked for my review, and couldn't find it. So I went to my Profile and there it was. Curious. So I selected ""Edit"" and tapped the ""add photo"" box and loaded from my files the photo's of the marks on my arm, which I had also loaded into my PC documents. I submitted them and waited. That was 6 hours ago. No change in my updated review ""with photo's"". Meanwhile, the ""marks"" had started to ooze a clear liquid. That FREAKED ME OUT! I called the VA hospital again and told them the new development. The attending ER physician said that most likely I was suffering from a contact chemical burn from the watch band and to come with the watch and they could have it analyzed. I haven't gone in as of yet. What I HAVE done is contact Amazon again and forcefully demand why my edited review that contained the photo's of the injury to my wrist were not posted? I am aware from experience that customer reviews are scanned by a team of the ""Communities"" section of Amazon to insure that the Community Rules and Guidelines are not ""violated"". OK. But what the hell does that have to do with me trying to raise an alarm to the buying public that Amazon is selling a dangerous product? Is my review being suppressed by Amazon in an effort to hide this and what they are selling? I gave the patient Amazon representative an earful, but he responded by assuring me that all that I had relayed to him would be delivered ASAP to his upper chain of command. He asked for my telephone number and stated that I would be contact by ""someone"" in Amazon internal investigations. Well, for now, I'm going to have to wait and see if that actually happens. I'm headed for the ER room in a few hours and I definitely will get an answer from them at least as to what in Gods name this watchband is made of and to have the wounds documented. And yes. I am contacting a legal representative of the Veterans Administration for advice as to what my rights are in regards to personal injury attained from a product sold by Amazon. If Amazon didn't like me because of my edited review, they sure as hell aren't going to once I file court papers on them. Anyway. There you have it. And like I have said in my last reviews, ""just the facts"".12/25/2018 11:43 AM PST Seattle, Washington, USAYesterday I contacted Amazon.com customer service. Asked if the they had received the 4 photos of the burn marks on my wrist. The agent acknowledge that she could see them on her monitor. I asked her what were my options. She said she would send me an e-mail with the Amazon Legal Contact information. She did send it. But it was only an address with no phone or e-mail link. The only way to contact them is through snail mail. But here is what has NOT happened. I was told that ""someone"" from Amazon would be contacting me in 6 hours. That was 12 hours ago. Maybe because of the Christmas holiday, no one is available?None the less. The Watch that caused my injuries is still listed on the Amazon web site. So. I am providing the product name, AND, the seller name for the sake of public discloser and safety.Item: Winhy 8 GB HD Waterproof Wrist DV Watch Camera Digital Video DVR Camcorder 1280 x 960 by WinhySeller: Jiad KdeI will continue to provide updates as they develop.","December 23, 2018"

It's when you have to return something or have an issue that the customer service is horrible. They don't do price adjustments for items that they sell. Additionally, over the years their services have slowly morphed into kinda accurate. Yes, two hour shipping is available- on select items and it's not immediate. You have to schedule your two hour time slot, which could be same day or not. They now charge for returns, so it may not even be worth the return if the shipping is more or just about what you paid.

I have rarely had to return any items and when I have, the process has always been quick and painless. Most recently, however, they have sent me a book with about 30 pages stuck together. Instead of them sending me a replacement (which is usually what happens when I go through the return process), they have asked me to send this item back for a refund.  I ordered the book in the Black Friday sale at about £2.79.  The book has now gone up up £7.99.  There is no way I would pay full price for the book so I am now a Christmas present short.  I wish they would have just replaced it as it was their fault for sending a faulty product to start with.","December 12, 2018"

Giving two stars because i have had great experience with buying and receiving for the most part off amazon but utilized customer service for the first time,that gets a zero star.  Super frustrating experience.  Bought an item on amazon as i had thought they had great policies for things such as price adjustments, a few days later the price dropped significantly on their site and several other sites were also cheaper.  I went on the chat, told the whole story, was transferred to someone else, they told me they could not adjust it but i could rebuy it (first) and then return the one I have.  I kept asking to get confirmation i would not need to pay to return without answer, I am glad I waited since of course there was a cost.  I  told the representative who then started acting like he was saying that the whole time (even though we have a transcript).  I expressed my concern and he said it was a pleasure assisting me which he did not.  Not only did I loose money but about a half an hour waiting on a chat, they must be talking to several people at once because the responses took forever.

Subscribe and Save is one of the coolest things we have seen in twenty years.  We have been Amazon Prime members for almost two years. BUT, BUT, BUT - I do not like Bezos' politics and I hate making him richer. I hate the fact that Amazon is still streaming NRA TV. But that aside the organization has internal problems. The shipping dept is LOUSY and must be poorly run. One in four packages we receive are poorly packed, have no bubbly wrap to protect the products or poorly boxed and shipped. This probably has to do with the volume they are processing BUT they need more personnel if it is not being done right. Where are the supervisors? My guess is that no one is paid what they should be paid to work or supervise at the company. Another reason to hate Bezos and his only interest being seemingly in profit and the bottom line and not in the customers' experiences. Typical corporate America.

But after today's customer care service I'm looking for another company to do my shopping. In April I bought the Amazon Kindle Fire 8 kids edition and it was great for about a month. Unfortunately my son ran the battery down and out of speaking to customer care I found out that was a common issue where once it dies it will not restart and has to be sent in. I resent it in and got a refurbished Kindle that had a scratch along the case. Cat scratch turned into a crack within a week and I returned it. Thankfully it has the 2-year unlimited replacement. The next one after maybe 2 weeks would only go to the Amazon reset menu. So I had to send it back in. This is around the 16th of November. By the 23rd I had not heard anything and contacted customer care who told me it was on its way and would be here within 3 to 5 days. As of today December 1st I contact to see where it was. I was told that it is out of stock and I would have to purchase the item again and once it got sent out they would refund me the money. I refuse to do that and after three agents, one supervisor and two hours I decide to cut my loss and take a partial credit. I went back do snapshot the screen to show my family and the Agents had deleted it off my side. I'm pretty sure that that's not in Amazon's policy. Thankfully it still shows on Amazon side and I took screenshots of where the conversation is missing and the Agent I was speaking to at the time verifying that I did in fact speak to these other agents. I'm pretty sad that Amazon is letting these kinds of individuals ruin their business.","December 01, 2018"

At 7:30, it said it would come by 9pm. I realized around 9:30 that it never came and now tracking said it will arrive within next two days. I called to see if there was anything they could do to make sure it can arrive by noon tomorrow. I felt like this was a fair request since they failed to deliver today as “guaranteee” on their site. He said “I can’t re route everything JUST for you package”. That was a really rude and unlike Amazon reply. After he said that, he got me in a fighting mood and I said so your “guarantee” is basically false advertising. He said “no if you ACTUALLY read our site... we are covered by that”. I was like “Hugh... I cannot believe Amazon is letting you represent them”. He also said at some point when he was reviewing my account  that I did not pay for this shipment  but after I hung up on him mid convo bc I was done dealing with his ignorant attitude, I realized that yes I do pay for shipping. I pay for prime for over $100 a year. Are you actually telling me that a non prime member is more valuable than a prime member? Anyhow... I am all for American jobs because is my country but it seems like those working in the other countries are WHOLE LOT more courteous and customer service focused. This “lead” seemwd like they jut pulled him off he street with his nasty attitude. I did call Amazon again to talk to another supervisor to make sure he “Dan” gets reprimanded. Anyhow “Dan” gave away a lot of Amazon’s inside scoop and how they think about their clients now. They value non-prime members more; their “guarantee” is not real and the verbiage on their site covers their guarantee not being real somewhere in fine print, and they are too big to care for you as client anymore. Also After speaking to this guy who was on the east coast in the US, their hiring decisions have declined because he was the worst.","November 25, 2018"

They’ve even gone above and beyond on fixing a few issues that I’ve had in the past. They took away my ability to review items and ask questions for a while without explanation which was very frustrating. Now I refuse to write many reviews because of that issue, but at least they restored my account. Overall, they have such convenient and well priced products and services that it would be hard for me to quit using Amazon.","November 01, 2018"

Apparently NOT!!! it has now gone up in price! Argued the fact I shouldn’t have to pay more for the same thing when it’s within the manufacturers warranty, and wanted more of an explanation as to why they couldn’t just send out a replacement as first offered? (my theory being it was due to the increase in price obviously, what else could it be) Getting nowhere asked to speak to a manager but to no avail,put on hold countless times (he was probably speaking to a manager) Upshot is no way was I getting a replacement, ended up with a refund into my amazon account, plus a goodwill jester of £15 off my next purchase!

Claim got denied, contacted support again and got on the line with a very helpful support agent, but since the last agent was so bad, there was little to do, we submit another claim to make amazon rethink the claim decision, but because it was still under the wrong issue, it got once again denied. Contacted them for third time and this time requested someone higher up, was forwarded to them and spoke to them for about 30 minutes, as final result, the agent forwarded the case to investigation. A day later I was contacted by Amazon, finally telling me that they will issue me a full price refund, this included product price, shipping and return shipping.

Sorting by price never works very well, showing items way out of place, or not showing some at all. Sometimes it groups things of multiple prices together. Amazon needs to either have all listings separate, or all grouped under one listing, not randomly broken up.I've only made a handful of purchases over the years. About half the time there are problems. Amazon support is terrible, and every time they've never read what I wrote, giving a hilariously irrelevant reply. They refund things in the end, but it's not worth the hassle.They always try to upsell their Prime service, and keep selecting the wrong shipping address out of the two I ship to. Once when I tried to get a deal they wouldn't honor the price it clearly said on the item page.","September 22, 2018"

They are also a treasure house of information and culture for every man, woman, and child with but a meager amount of money. Seems to me the only drawback is their inability to deliver fast enough via drone delivery, but that's a SNAFU at the FAA, not at Amazon. Jeff: you are a Great American.

Great for buying books, movies, games and other low priced items. Disaster if buying anything over their marketplace. You have 90 days protection from Amazon, taken from the ""estimated delivery date"" and not the actual date you receive your items! After that your on your own. I bought £300 surround sound system from a seller via Amazon. The payee was Amazon! The system stopped working after 10 weeks, the day I was going on holiday. I reported the fault to the seller, again via the Amazon website, on my return 10 days later. This however was 3 days after my 90 day Amazon guarantee ran out (taken from the estimated date of delivery and not the actual date of delivery 5 or 6 days later). The seller (Picsio) have never replied to any of my emails and the number to call is never answered. Yet because I am now 3 months after the purchase I am unable to leave the seller a negative comment and nobody wants to honour my consumer rights?

Don't get me wrong, I'm not going to ""dump Amazon Prime"" like others suggest.  I'm simply going to deal with them cautiously.My first complaint is their search algorithm.  Last night, I was looking for watches.  Amazon's initial search returned over 10,000 results.  I didn't want to wade through 10,000 result so I decided to change the sort from [Default] to [Price Low to High].  I didn't narrow the search in ANY way.  The new results dropped to 100.  I literally lost over 9,900 purchase options.  I was forced to go back to the previous search results and wade through a ton of crap that was of no interest to me.  It literally too me a half hour to find a Timex watch that should have shown up on the low end of prices when I changed the sort order but it was eliminated in those results.  What the hell is that???My next complaint is that they've changed their ""Two Day Shipping"" policy.  I understand that this change occurred some time ago but the point is that you have to pay attention to WHEN the item ships.  Two days is no longer calculated from the date of order but from the date of ship.  In some cases, shipping won't occur for a couple of weeks!My third complaint is that their customer service used to be automatic.  They would take responsibility when things went wrong and they'd offer a resolution without even being asked.  Today, getting Amazon to take responsibility for broken promises is like pulling teeth.  I used to give them 5 stars for customer service but today, I'd be hard pressed to give them anything more than 2.5.Bottom line.  Amazon is no longer the go-to for me and I shop around before placing ANY orders there.  Besides finding better pricing in other places, there are many browser add-ons and apps that offer me additional savings or money back on my purchases with other retailers.  I would have given them 2 stars but I do get some use out of the included streaming benefit.","September 13, 2018"

They would go on to produce the availability of books for anyone at any place in the country. Prior he would have to go down to your local bookstore, wait for an order book to come in. And that could be anywhere from 2 to 3 weeks. Even when Amazon first started books were easily arriving within a week or two at the most much faster than going down to your corner store. Online changed shortly after they were in the book business. They started branching out into other areas and eventually would have third-party sellers and their system.it seemed about 2010 or 11, the problems began with Amazon as they were allowing more more third-party sellers to operate on their websites, this invited a lot of scams and subpar overseas products being sold. It appears at this point in 2018 approximate half the stuff that sold on Amazon is imported, and is not made in this country, and is not quality. Why you can't find top brands and high quality, often times people are up to buy a product that looks similar, and appears the same, but is more of a knockoff or limitation. I am not thinking that they commit fraud, as Amazon seems to be pretty good about keeping that out of the system.Having been a customer with Amazon for so long I have seen the customer service become worse and worse over the years. When I first would contact them many years ago they seem to know a lot of the policies, and could resolve an issue usually within a day. I am now working on a problem I've had with Amazon since January 2018 and is now September 2018, and they seem completely lost in trying to solve a very simple problem. The other issue is they are now using overseas call centers something that Amazon originally stated in press releases that they would not do. Now we have people that do not have direct contact with Amazon Corporation answering phones, which means everything you do has to be relayed to the corporate office of some kind before it gets resolved if it ever does. Like so many companies that have been around from a long time, they have lost touch with their customer base. And have become 100% about the bottom line profit. Even their delivery system is faltering, I have noticed the last five years products are late, damaged, or missing. It was hard to believe this year alone we had for missing lost products that never made it to the town I live in. They were lost in shipping, how do you lose products in shipping? The items would often arrive bang that been damaged it really does not matter what the carrier was. I had seen products that were packed by the Amazon Corporation and then shipped out damaged inside the box, but the box was fine on the outside. Showing clear that Amazon ship the product to the carrier knowing it was damaged. This is the kind of customer service we are getting nowadays for the money we spend on prime and other products they sell. I am very disappointed in the last five years of service and Amazon, it is nothing like it was before.","September 10, 2018"

I especially love the possibility to read reviews of products from real life people.However many scammers abuse system and get fake reviews which is possibly impossible to get rid of.Never had problem with returning items. Compared to eBay this service is on top level. Also compared to eBay noone is spamming you asking for leaving feedback! Love the ability to see on map how close the item is when using Amazon Prime.Also there is an option for sellers to sell all their product and let Amazon sell it themselves which makes this website amazing. I had many similar ideas in past that amazon have invented a bit earlier like FBA. Well done for hiring innovative minds! I would like to share few ideas for innovation however I don't believe such big player would share its profits with me :)What are bad points?Many fake reviews like mentioned before.Uploaded videos are in super bad quality, Make it useless when someone wants to show his own review as a video or to show if HD is real HD so people could see themselves.Sometimes there is little choice of specific product. For example foot insoles or steelcap boots/trainers/shoes.Overall Amazon receives 4 stars out of 5 for being innovative and moving with times and technology compared to others. Losing one star for being too little competitive when it comes to product availability, probably because of Fulfilled by Amazon option in which many participating sellers hesitate with sending new stock. This makes buyers search for other shops offering specific product.","September 10, 2018"

So I pay for the 1-day delivery and I receive it, many times, after 3-4 days.If you ask their support, they simply copy-paste the same message asking to open a ticket, where they can tell you: ""We can't do anything, it's a courier fault"".Sure, you can send it back if it's late, but if I purchase something, usually I do it because I need it, so I can't be choosy and send it back.This is really disgusting.","August 02, 2018"

Huge product range, relatively fast and cheap shipment options to New Zealand. What's not to like?Well, Amazon Prime video... The movies and TV shows they offer to NZ customers are better than Netflix NZ, but it is impossible to watch 'em. Due to that stupid Google vs Amazon discussion, you can't stream via Chromecast (yeah, cast via computer = annoying as it's in the other room and screen mirroring on mobile isn't reliable).Amazon's Firestick isn't available in NZ... Roku is shipped to NZ but then the Amazon Prime channel isn't available. Unless you do the VPN trick but then Amazon blocks videos that should be available in NZ.

When I did catch up with them I was told I had not ordered anything and they had not taken anything from my  account, so nothing to worry about. I called my card provider and they informed me that the money had been taken from my account. I then looked at my options and decided I would be better with nothing to do with Amazon. Then I received a message in German from the supplier of the goods. I still don't know what the messages were about as my German isn't up to much, but they seemed to be trying to get in touch and I presumed this was about delivery of the goods, now two days late. At that point I went back to my card provider. Their grounds for contesting a charge seem quite limited, and the only one open to me was non-delivery. I contested the charge on that basis, pointing out that Amazon said I hadn't paid anything, while their accounts showed the contrary. the day after I sent off the formal notice to my card provider the goods were left on my doorstep. Nobody signed for them. Next day I sent Amazon a message bringing them up to date and got a reply telling me I would have to log into my account but that is still non-existent as far as Amazon UK is aware. To log into my account I need information which I do not have and they say does not exist. They don't even recognise the email on which we have exchanged several messages in the past few days and want me to find a lot of further information which they say they don't have and which doesn't exist anyway, so that I can get rid of the goods they say I don't have,  that I now don't want. Somewhere there's a simple failure to communicate between Germany where the supplier is based, and the UK where I am based. But I am aware that some supplier in Germany is short of goods and money, which is unfair. And I have heard recently that Amazon's treatment of its junior employees is pretty rough, so I don't want to put any of the staff I have been dealing with into the firing line. What is to be done?Three weeks later Amazon have responded adequately, accepting that they should have realised that my email ending .googlemail.com, which they had, was the same as .gmail.com which i have been using since google changed it. They offered a way of returning the goods which is so  complicated that I have given them to charity, their alternative suggestion.","July 16, 2018"

(or FedEx or UPS) I am 3/4 of a mile from the mailbox and the USPS only has to go 1/2 mile to deliver a package to your door. On ""Amazon Sunday"" those US Postal Service rules do not apply. On regular days, they drag their feet and I have to pick everything up at the post office...but on Sunday, everything is brought directly to my door. Go figure *that* one out.Having Amazon Prime, I would like to be able to specify the delivery date. I know it would cost them more, but hey...they just raised the price of Prim by 20 bucks anyhow. Their billions can handle it...and I'd buy more stuff.","July 03, 2018"

Firstly, would be the pricing of items. Some items are highly overpriced and some were not brand new! I had trouble with my amazon account in the past due to address verification system (incorrect billing address), Amazon account specialist closed my account after a few orders. I had about 10 orders rage between 100-250 USD and my account was closed when I tried to order a new PC (600+ USD). Initially my account was put on hold and was asked to verify my billing statement.

Well worth the annual fee in what they save me on shipping charges, not to mention the added bonus of their Prime video service. There are many things I don't buy on Amazon because, when I can, I still like to patronize small local vendors, even if it costs me a few dollars more than Amazon. However Amazon's prices are admittedly often difficult to beat. They also have great customer service and have quickly resolved every problem I've ever had. However, one problem I've sometimes had, and many other Amazon customers complain about, are their packaging monkeys (one star off for that). It's not uncommon where they'll take a small package and ship it in a larger box with no padding. Good way to wind up with damaged merchandise that has to be returned (thankfully Amazon always covers the return shipping). One thing I rarely fail to do is when trying to decide between Product A, B, C I read Amazon customer reviews. There's a wealth of knowledge to be gained from reading the experiences of other customers who've bought a particular product. I also love being able to post my questions and get responses from other customers. Thank you Amazon!","June 28, 2018"

Although I'd have to say that their Pass the Parcel scheme is good in practice it's just not best when you go to one of these designated places and they look down upon you for daring to do a refund in their shop. But clearly not an Amazon issue. My only issue and it would be more search related is that some items are cryptically hidden on the website so you will need to be really specific or it may just not be on there.

Billion dollar companies that cant be bothered to sort out a decent app that works on your mobile well is just well stupid in this day and age. The amazon app ive never had a problem with. Order, pay, print FREE return labels is a doddle. Ebay and paypal app are probably the worst things on my phone, way too buggy imo","April 30, 2018"

I've just been told that my item won't be released unless I pay £32.  The item itself was £52 and I paid £52 for delivery.  That means that costs have now exceeded the value of the goods.  Absolutely ridiculous.My options are to pay, or let the item be returned.  I have to add that I didn't buy this item off Amazon but when I told Parcelforce Coventry that I'd ordered high value items in the past with no problems, she said that I'd just been lucky not to have received a surcharge.

I purchased a bunk bed online at a great price.  Well apparently it was priced incorrectly and they cancelled my order with out notifying me.  First I don't think it's best practice for a business not to honor their prices they list but Amazon covered that in their terms and conditions... but what about notifying me, that is mentioned in their terms and conditions?!!!  I ordered it several days ago.  Amazon's terms and conditions state that they will notify you.  Well they violated their contract.  I had plans for the bunk bed.  Now my granddaughters old beds will be picked up on Wednesday and they will have no bed!  Thank you amazon for not holding up your end of the bargain.  A purchase is a contract and I held up my end, they did not. Also they are not refunding me for 7-10 days so I can't even go to a store and buy a bed until they give me the money to.  This is by far the worst experience I have ever had with amazon.  And I have been an avid Amazon promoter and shopper for several years.  I will no longer provide them my business if they cannot operate with integrity and honor their end of the bargain.

However, Amazon's customer service is where the ratings drop.  It's obviously outsourced, so you immediately face a language barrier and wind up having to slowly repeat your issue several times. Representatives will make you promises (such as gift cards as an apology for messing up an order, or a refund of your shipping on a late item), and then just never put it into the system, so when you call to check the status, you're told the conversation never happened.

For me, they've always quickly resolved issues with products sold by them. The returns policy is easy to complete. The third party sellers may take longer but they too, in the main, tend to deal with matters sensibly. It helps to provide photographs.The review system is a good way to voice any praise and complaints and helps the future customer to judge for themselves, though I suspect many of the gushing reviews are false positives.I find the emails which provide updates of purchase, delivery, and the tracking particularly useful.The only problems I've had were with sellers from abroad and that's usually due to transport delays/lost in post or wrong product information. They seem to have a stock photo which can misrepresent the actual item. Their couriers have mostly all been pleasant. I've heard about the pressure they're under to deliver within a certain time and have tried to offer tips, none of which have been accepted!P.S. I'd forgotten about the packaging. Sometimes they go overboard with huge boxes and swathes of horrid paper for small items and other times, squash expensive items together with 'air bags' that have burst by the time they've reached you because the outer box has been squished. Once, the Amazon sealing tape wasn't stuck on properly which was surprising as it's normally impossible to pry off. So, minus a star.","February 17, 2018"

However, I do wish their Prime membership would be a little bit more consistent than it is with me.       I usually do all my Amazon.com shopping with my Prime membership and supposedly I am supposed to receive my goods within 2 business days but I usually do not, I receive them within 2-4 business days and in my eyes that is unacceptable.  I think for the price I pay for Prime I can live with that turnaround time but if a business says something and they advertise the living Hell out of it and everybody is expecting it, why can't they DELIVER IT then?  I'm just sayin'...     Their website is one of the most intuitive, user-friendly, cute and professional-looking websites I have seen on the Internet.  I can't honestly think of any other website that is better to look at than Amazon's.  The use of color, the way they place their buttons, the overall GUI interface... all top-notch.  I have rarely had to contact customer service about an item and I have never returned an item here, it is truly a well-oiled machine.  I have 350 reviews of items on Amazon.com and counting ( I am a professional reviewer ).     Amazon.com is the best website on the Net and deservedly so.  There is NOTHING out there like it!","January 04, 2018"

Mmmmmm!,"One of Amazon's third party sellers is ""Electrical Emporium,"" seemingly a trade name of Powerforce Distribution Limited.Despite receiving an email from the CEO stating all the usual ""bumph"" about how pleased he was with me buying a product from his company..... and if I have any concern in the future....... His employees cannot put the correct label on the appropriate product: I ordered a Vax vacuum cleaner. What did I get, a steam iron!I have no complaint with Amazon ""per say"" other than they immediately refunded the money and told me to keep the iron. However, that didn't help me purchase a particular model Vax vacuum cleaner, that I spent many hours considering against other makes and models to suit my wife and I using, as ""senior citizens"" with cats and dog fur to clean up etc.Now, I receive an email from Electrical Emporium asking me to return the product using the pre-paid label!!! What product? The one I didn't receive or the iron that Amazon told me to dispose of?Hello? To those it may concern, does any party talk to the other?I give up!I shall just ask Amazon and Electrical Emporium to read this review.

Okay, I am not saying I haven't had issues with the product being cheaply made, or not matching expectation, or sellers, and I almost ALWAYS have problems with the mail carriers (especially USPS).  I AM saying Amazon (I do have Prime) has the best customer service regardless of your issue or who you purchased it from, that I have ever experienced.  I have had one issue in the several years of buying from them with a thoughtless package where a book was just thrown in and was torn to shreds (not literally but very close to literally) and it was THEIR fault. However, it was so easy to return that it was HARD to be upset (although I was because it was a last minute Christmas gift that I couldn't give and that left me with only one small thing. However it was my fault for waiting, I was moving at the time, and it was so preventable). I was quickly calmed down by their customer service rep, and they made it so easy. Of course the UPS guy never showed up the BOTH times Amazon scheduled a pick up but again that's my mail carriers I have to put up with. Ugh. Anyway, after a long pointless story, my review is just saying I really, honestly, just really do love Amazon.","January 03, 2018"

They delivered it to the wrong address and I never got it, even after checking with USPS and all my neighbors.I contacted Amazon about this, and they had a replacement shipment out the same day with expedited 1-day shipping. One of my items had to be refunded instead of replaced because it was sold by a 3rd party seller, so I got an additional $10 voucher for any purchase and was able to place that order in time to get it for my Secret Santa event still!I just placed another order and my receipt said that the items were to be delivered on a Sunday. My heart sunk and I reached out to customer service again to ask them if they could have the order delivered on the next day, Monday. Instead, they chose to expedite the shipping to 1-day shipping!I can't believe how above and beyond they went for me!

I like that I can return things I impulsively bought and get refunded for it. Also, I love that I know what my friends are getting for me on my birthday and Christmas. Honestly, Amazon has also fed my addiction to books that I buy to look smart and not read (although I don't think it makes me look smart when all I buy are repeat volumes of Captain Underpants, but a copy of The Art of War balances it out I think). I'm currently waiting for a portable guitar. And before you say it, I know, all guitars are portable, but it's the one with like three frets and six-strings and you sort of just bring it around everywhere. Trust me, it's kind of cool. A lot of the things I've gotten from Amazon have been good. No complaints really. ALTHOUGH, the recent purchases I have (baring the portable guitar) been sad face qualities, so I returned it. And guess what? It was so easy! In any case, I think I have used Amazon to encourage my ""don't talk to people and stay in the darkness of your room"" ways. To be honest, I'm on my way to becoming a hermit and Amazon makes it possible. Thank you, Amazon! Cheers!","October 11, 2017"

Unfortunately Amazon US is not trustworthy. I ordered a TV, and they put me into Scheduled delivery section due to the size of the TV. I ordered on a Sunday, and followed up on Monday--Thursday via chat and phone call.  Everytime they said, different things, -- It will ship within a couple of days. -- I will ship next week. -- I will escalate and find out. Finally on Thursday one agent told me: ""Oh I am sorry, I dont think we have an inventory for this, we will have to refund""So I lost a gift opportunity here. In order to ""please"" me, they then offered a discount as refund on the 2ns TV I bought. When I get the refund receipt it said: Reason for refund: Damaged during transit. This was plain wrong, the TV didn't even reach the destination and the refund was for them being wrong in lying to me. I followed up and got that corrected. So their agents were all pretending to help me earlier with a bunch of mis-information, and later they were trying to hide that under the hood by calling it a shipping problem.","September 02, 2017"

Their prices aren't always the best but their customer service is great, in my experience.  I make several purchases every month but I do shop around to make sure I'm getting the best deal and I pay special attention to who the seller is.  I'm a Prime member so I get things relatively quickly.  Recently, I received an envelope that was empty.  I realized there was a small hole in the corner where I believe the item fell out (or was taken out).  I really feel bad when things like this happen but I can't be paying $20 for an empty envelope.  There were very apologetic.  It was a Prime day special but they refunded me and said they would credit me back on the discount, which I greatly appreciated.","September 01, 2017"

For me, it`s definitely acceptable and I haven`t really got any huge complaints. Now, here`s the primary little irks - the only real problems I have had with the company, and to be fair it`s more with the delivery than anything else:I might say that 90% of orders are fine but it`s not been totally uncommon to receive a heavily damp package - damp not exactly because of rain but because of what I imagine is just a highly humid method of storage. My preference is for books and tech-related items so whilst normally I can not complain much about this issue, I`m not fully convinced that my orders will arrive in good condition, as of course, these items are particularly sensitive to damage when damp. Now, the professionalism of a tiny few of the courier services leave a lot to desire. Let`s say that one in twenty of my packages - most concerningly common: laptops - are delivered to the wrong house, in spite of correct address written down at the order time. There were no knocks, zero notes through my letterbox or really any indication of where it has gone. I have to run around the neighbourhood knocking on everyone`s doors like I`m playing Trick-or-Treat. If they (the courier) do bother to knock, packages are often quite heavily bashed around and can be dirty. I don`t exactly expect the delivery driver to rub my feet and call me pookie but carelessness just creates more problems for everyone involved.I don`t wanna call out names for the particular courier service I solely seem to have issues with, after all, they are mostly acceptable, so I`ve written it down in the form of a fun anagram for all the family: REYESHMMAs long as they are not actually broken, I do not mind this, but it`s the carelessness and chance of damage that doesn`t fill me with hope. It`s worth mentioning that I don`t think I have ever had a package that is late, so thumbs up for that. So, for those thinking of ordering expensive items: be careful and make sure to research.For less-expensive items (aside from books), I honestly haven`t had any issues, really.I`ve also heard of numerous people being charged for Amazon Prime after valid cancellation - even years after. So: if you have a particularly low balance on your credit card at any moment, watch out for this.","August 30, 2017"

I.know there's been some controversy over reviews but I want to set the record straight. There are many people that provide legitimate, honest reviews on products, they aren't paid, swayed or compensated in any way. I don't know how it came to be if you review a lot of stuff, your writing ""fake"" reviews. I buy almost everything from Amazon so I write tons of reviews and I can honestly say I've never written a untruthful review in my life, ever. I can't say that everyone in the world writes honest reviews but what I can say is don't disregard a review if the person reviews a lot of items. I enjoy sharing my thoughts on products because I always read reviews, I hope in paying it forward.Amazon also has exceptional customer service, it didn't start out this way they had terrible, hard to understand reps who didn't provide a solution to your issue and didn't care. This is all changed, they respond quickly, efficiently and provide an immediate solution, it's truly one of the best companies in terms of service out there.I wish they would stay away from buying grocery stores and expanding, people don't realize if you automate everything, YOU WILL CRUSH THE ECONOMY! You can't take away cashier, stocking, manager and every other job that regular grocery stores need without having major consequences. PLEASE stop, you have a great footprint already and have put tons of companies out of business but this grocery store business will have devastating effects. Stay with the online website and I'll continue to give you my business.","August 07, 2017"

Every once in a while, a package arrives a date later than it should have - not the end of the world...I do have a few specific gripes, though. Why do they not have parental controls on Amazon Music Unlimited yet? This seems absolutely ridiculous to me - and if you do a quick Google search on this topic, you'll see a massive amount of unhappy people complaining. For parents, this is an absolute necessity, and a bizarre oversight on Amazon's part. My other issue is with Amazon Fresh. First of all, the price. Holy cow. It's a great convenience, but all the other local grocery delivery services are far cheaper. Also, it always seems like something goes wrong with these deliveries; whether it's all four of my bread items expire in three days from the delivery date, or half my order is delivered on time, but the other half is off in outer space and nobody can seem to track it down...I just can't figure out why these things aren't fixed by now. Train your people correctly. Track your deliveries. Easy stuff for a giant like Amazon.Other than those things, Amazon has been my favorite go-to online shopping place for many, many years, and I can't imagine it ever being replaced. Their customer service reps almost always fix your issues, and generally go above what you expected as a remedy. Their prices are almost always the best around (and you can always track prices via camel camel camel).","July 12, 2017"

One thing missing from AMAZON is their inability to promote books posted or published on their websites. I believe that this type of outlet should develop a format to introduce new entries to their published list, and to maintain such rooster continually for up to 90 days after posting of a new book title, (even at a small cost to the authors is acceptable). Doing so, does not translate to an endorsement of a book, rather informative to the audiences worldwide. The AMAZON prominence position them to champion this option. Because the idea of listing a book title on their portal, without publicity, is like planting a flower without intention to add water for germination. Development of ""AMAZON BookTV"" where such is platformed is no a bad idea considering the corporate standard.","June 29, 2017"

I have been a member since 2010 and a Prime Member for about 3 years and while I have come across some problems such as late deliveries, or deliveries to the wrong address so I have to check with neighbors things of that nature, for that bit of aggravation, I do have to say their Customer Service is second to none. I always deal with very pleasant Customer Service reps and if I am not satisfied with their answer to my question or problem I then ask for a Lead and I am 99% lucky in that area that they will usually listen and treat me with respect , see where I am coming from and grant my wish. Only time they have their hands tied and I do agree and understand where they are coming from is if it is a merchant that the item in question is from then I have to wait to get an  email back from the merchant before I can go further. They do have an A to Z Guarantee which doesn't always work unfortunately but More times then not it does and I am happy for it. So for those who have had a not so great experience just know its happening to others but you just have to keep on top of them as I do and look at their awesome merchandise, daily deal etc. You can't go wrong.","March 22, 2017"

When they arrived the package was in a bad shape. Upon opening it I saw the books were bent out of shape due to water damage and the pages wrinkled.I therefore requested a replacement from Amazon.com, this was not an issue and I was pleased with their return policy other than the fact I had to pay the majority of the return shipping costs myself (about 30 euros). Even with these extra costs the books were still cheaper from Amazon than from anywhere in the EU and I was in no rush so I was still very pleased.However when the replacements arrived it immediately became apperent that these too had suffered water damage, albeit to a lesser extent than the first ones. At this point asking for a replacement once again would put the total price of the books and return shipping over the price of simply ordering them elsewhere and I decided to cut my losses.Amazons return policy was good, their shipping quality less so.TL;DRReceived damaged books from amazon, payed shipping to replace them, received new damage books.","March 13, 2017"

I order from them very regularly, and rarely incur a problem they don't strive to fix.I recently (just last year) decided to sign up for Prime since our household uses Amazon almost on a weekly basis, and while they offer lots of great perks in addition to the faster shipping (TV shows, movies, discounts, etc.)  it seems as though the amount of items they host that are Prime eligible has lessened as the program has gone on. Maybe I'm wrong, but it feels like when I signed up, virtually everything on their main site was eligible for Prime shipping, and now it seems to be at the seller's discretion (when a third party seller is involved.)As a whole though, great company! And the annual cost for Prime is definitely worth it for the perks you get.","March 09, 2017"

Prime is great, and if you do a lot of online shopping you should definitely sign up.  To be able to get almost anything within 2 days with free shipping is amazing.  I hate going to stores (I am male after all), and the cheap prices aside for most things waiting 2 days is just as good as getting it right now.  And the extra benefits of free Prime videos and shows, music, etc. make it a no brainer.I have never had something go wrong that, as long as I contacted them reasonably close to the purchase date they have not gone out of their way to make right.Most of the third party sellers are reputable.  I have had some disappointments with shoddy products that did not show up for some time with them.  But those have been rare.Amazon is definitely, to me, the gold standard for online retail.  Given their success I am sure I am not alone.Also, I have their FireTV which makes any cable box look like a piece of garbage.   I would definitely recommend it as well.  It goes great with Prime videos, Netflix and any online streaming that you would watch on your TV itself (which is how I want to watch my content).","December 17, 2016"

If you read their company filings or look for them at the SEC website, they specify how much they lower prices each year as a result of efficiencies/productivity gains they put in place through greater scale or ""pricing power"" with suppliers.  The lower prices drive greater market share so pricing can drop further, and a virtuous cycle is established.  My wife has Amazon Prime, and we make around 40 purchases a year with them.  None of our purchases have ever been damaged due to packaging/handling issues.  Though the rise of Amazon may be death knell for many smaller competitors, I recommend them highly.","December 11, 2016"

However, my complaint is with the Amazon Echo/Dot. I live in the UK and recently purchase a Dot thinking it would be everything I need.Wrong! And sadly so. No matter how I speak to this thing, it rarely understands what I'm saying and it has been programmed to sound human in the way that she will reply, ""Hmm, I don't seem to have the answer to that one."" And to be quite honest I'm getting totally sick of hearing this phrase and similar ones.I think a major part of the problem lies in understanding what I'm saying. And to this end I contacted the dedicated Echo Dot department who sad to say suggested I go through the 'voice training' ... Sad because there isn't a voice training facility to be had. There apparently is supposed to be one, but there isn't.If it did exist it would be 25 phrases for the user to use in trying to get Alexa to understand what your asking. I found an email address for the CEO of Amazon who apparently stated for all to see, ""If my customers are not happy, then I am not happy' (or words to that effect) It also said that he was very hands on and gave out his email address because he valued his customers input and apparently dealt with these emails himself? I sent one asking for help seeing as his dedicated Dot help centre could not, so far he has failed to reply. I think it's been four or five days now. The other maddening thing about this Dot is that she/it appears to know very little about the UK? One example of this is that I genuinely forgot a name of a television presenter and asked Alexa, ""Who hosted 'Who want to be a millionaire?'""It replied, ' Chris Harrison'.I had by this time recalled the name I wanted and it obviously was not Chris Harrison. So I asked it,  ""Who is Chris Tarrant?"" to which it/she replied, ""Hmm, I don't know the answer to that one.""So my point is, we have a gadget that appears to be geared up to answering questions concerning America ... In the UK?Actually, I think I've had enough now. I am going to accept the possible loss of £50.00 and disconnect this annoying useless toy. Maybe if ECHO grows up, then so to will its little boy, but until it does, I'm done with it.","November 20, 2016"

I order numerous products all throughout the year and their selection is PHENOMENAL. I am almost ALWAYS able to find what I need on the site. They offer brand new, refurbished/reconditioned and used products. The site is easy to navigate and has detailed, easy-to-use search options. You can save many items onto a personal wish list and also add items to your shopping cart to purchase at a later date, and you can add several shipping addresses and different payment options to your account.My most recent order included a Dolamee D5 brand Android TV box. I also ordered a wireless keyboard/mouse/remote combo to go along with it. I was under a 30-day Amazon Prime trial and so I got Free 2-day shipping on both items. (I was also able to find a HDMI to RCA/AV converter box on Amazon, since I have an older TV) All three items came within the 2-day shipping time-frame and they were packaged well. Everything worked like a charm with no problems whatsoever. Amazon always sends me reminders to review the products I purchase and I often do. In the rare case I ever need a replacement or refund, they make the process as simple and easy as possible. Amazon customer service is pretty good. They respond to my inquiry messages usually within 24 hours or less. The only reason I don't give them 5 stars is because there have been instances where the customer service I received resulted in an unfavorable outcome. This is extremely, extremely, rare, however, and does not occur anywhere near often enough to keep me from giving the site a high rating. I plan to continue to be an Amazon customer for many years to come.","November 11, 2016"

Having the Prime membership also ensures that you will get your item in at least 2 days.

I've purchased hundreds of items across a myriad of departments on Amazon, and have never EVER had an issue with returning an item that didn't fit or was not as described. I'm so grateful for Amazon, and recommend my friends and family to shop on Amazon for all their online shopping needs. Years ago, I used to shop on eBay, and found that the whole auction thing was actually kind of fun. However, I ended up having issues with fraud in my PayPal account, and realized that this would continue so long as I was forced to use a middleman to complete my online purchases. With Amazon, there is no middleman and never has been any fraud in my debit account that can be traced back to an Amazon purchase. They're very protective of their customers' financial information, and refunds are quick and easy. I will never, EVER shop eBay again, especially in light of how many scammers are starting to infest eBay's sellers market. It's really too bad that eBay doesn't do as good a job at protecting their customers as Amazon does. Thank you Amazon for being so awesome!","October 03, 2016"

Next day delivered, tried it, didn't like it and process a refund from the web. Print the label, take it to Royal Mail and days later you get a refund.Twice they failed ""Next Day"". Twice I called their support team with a mild complaint. Twice they added one month to my Prime membership as compensation.Sometimes you pay a little more for the same product under Prime but not much.

After two weeks and no communication, the seller cancelled, leaving me high and dry.  Furthermore, there was no possible way to even leave feedback about this negative transaction.   I've had other transactions which I have had to dispute as well, costing much time.  While Amazon always has pulled through when I have disputed orders, my overall impression is going downhill.

I've been a customer for 18 years, and a prime customer for a few years.No longer. In early 2016, they switched from using actual delivery services, such as USPS, FedEx or UPS, to their own, farmed-out service, ""Amazon Logistics."" Make no mistake, Amazon Logistics is not part of Amazon. It consists entirely of Uber-like drivers in your local area. If you have a white Ford Econoline van, you can be ""Amazon Logistics"" tomorrow. And if you can hire a couple of homeless guys to drive the vans, you can actually make some money.Unfortunately, you get what you paid for. These homeless drivers can't find addresses, don't know how to navigate streets, and sure as heck aren't bonded, so gated communities, condos, apartment complexes, etc, are not going to give them keys -- in stark contrast to UPS, USPS, FedEx, etc. My previous ~800 purchases delivered via those big three were all perfect, except for one. My 12 or so deliveries since they switched to Amazon Logistics have been 0-12. Customer service is useless. Yes, I've been credited for all of the botched deliveries. But it's confusing as to why a company that is so focused on customer service, and renowned for its efficiency, would all of a sudden entrust the final mile of the process to... anyone. Literally, anyone; no background check, no bonding, no verification of insurance, anything. I cancelled my Prime membership as a result, and got the canned ""sorry to see you go,"" email.Amazon's own discussion forum has over 1,000 complaints about Amazon Logistics, and form my research, not a single positive post. Yet Amazon seems to be willing to let those thousands (and many, many more who don't post) wander away, in order to save a few pennies. So be it.","July 26, 2016"

I mainly use prime for shipping.  Not for free movies and books.  When I contacted them about service I got a small credit and a story about warehouses in strategic locations for expedited shipping.  Really don't care about how many warehouses they have or if they have to swap stock items between warehouses.  I order something, then I expect it delivered in 2 or 3 days because I paid for prime shipping.  End of story to me.  Not Amazon's story.  I have repeatedly had to navigate their site to send a message regarding delivery.  Normally their shipping and delivery estimates are off I am waiting and waiting for my item to be processed then shipped.  The waiting 3 5 or 6 days on them to ship something and then see it expedited doesn't make me happy..  Well, what bothers me is that because their swapping between warehouses isn't my fault, but the checkout button says I can pay more to have stuff shipped when it becomes available.  I already paid for prime.  So when I order 4 things in 1 cart order - my entire orders sits.  I started making separate orders for a while and then often I needed something that is a +$25 add on item.  Just tired over amazon's game.","June 15, 2016"

It started GREAT would have given a 5 star, however, in the last 6 months it's going down hill fast. I'm suppose to get Free 2 day shipping. No, it's maybe 3 day at best mostly because they use USPS which could care less when you get your mail & in what condition. What ever happened to the promise of DRONES! AND since packages come through USPS they look as if they've been run over by the delivery trucks/carts. THEN, you have to deal with Amazon Customer Service to get products replaced or returned & that is a chore. It's like dealing with foreign high school students.

We use it on a daily basis. Amazon makes shopping a pleasure. You don't have to go thru the hassle of getting dressed, driving to the store, finding a parking place & dealing with sales people (most of whom are on a commission so they worry you to death by being pushy, insistent & aggressive to make a sale & earn $$$). You have to find a dressing room, undress to try on clothing (when the dressing room is usually a mess from prior custormers use), get dressed and go to checkout where the sales person will try to get you to sign up for the store' card (when you already have Visa or Mastercard, etc). Then you have to trek back to your car and deal with traffic going home,  Amazon eliminates all the above aggravation (you can sit in your ""PJ's) drink your coffee, eat your snack and browse at any hour day or night, compare all your items of interest, make a decison, pay with your card, then click to complete the purchase. With Prime you get free shipping in 2-days. Usually the prices on Amazon are very competitive (usually lower than in the stores).

Sometimes an item doesn't work out or is defective and I don't have to waste much time or effort to make it right with Amazon (no driving and waiting in line or lengthy arbitration process). Thank you Amazon you've grown for a reason.","April 01, 2016"

However, do not use their registry service.  The registry sent my recipient the wrong item, which they had to return (it happens.)  However, they also charged me twice for the item while saying they received the return successfully.  Everything in my Amazon account shows that the return was received and processed successfully.  So I had to contact Amazon to dispute the second charge on my credit card.  However, if you ordered off the registry standard Amazon service cannot help you.  You need to talk to the registry department and they have limited hours.  So I had to call back when the registry department opened.  Eventually I got the issue sorted, but with an underhanded charge to my credit card, and limited support availability this is not the Amazon I have dealt with in the past.","March 14, 2016"

Howver, regarding boots, shoes, and some other goods:While shopping for boots have you ever noticed the same model of the same brand is said to run big on one site, small on another, get 5 stars here, or three stars there? People from one site swear by this brand or this style, others have nothing but complaints? I have been in the re-sale business of shoes for several years now and have noticed several interesting quirks when researching and reselling shoes. The era of 6pm and Amazon have (unfortunately) created loopholes for customers who think they can count on a brand name (even Frye, Keen, Sorel, etc) for quality. 6pm and Amazon frequently (if not always) sell cheaper low quality versions. For example: The boots you buy from the company are all leather with a leather sole and welted construction (sole sewn to the boot) for example, but Amazon's are glued together with rubber soles. Full grain leathers are used on the company's boots, split leathers are used on the others. I don't know why the brand's allow for this blatant misuse of their names and logos (except that it must be profitable), but be aware that what you are buying through these companies will not last and is not the quality you may be expecting.","January 29, 2016"

My husband has prime shipping, so most items arrive within 2 to 3 days. I have had some problems with some returns--not getting a full refund on products on I returned because of the seller's policy. I had some difficulties with a merchant this Christmas, but the merchant handled the problem to my satisfaction. You just have to be careful that the merchant does not charge a restocking or return fee, especially if the mistake was the merchant's fault. My husband ordered an item from a seller on amazon and it was defective. When he contacted the company, they sent him a return address label but it was not prepaid, so we had to pay the shipping fee to return it. I told him he should have refused to pay for return shipping since the item was defective, and he needs to mention that in his review of the seller. Overall, though, I have had mostly positive experiences with amazon and will continue to use them.

However, that being said Amazon Prime is terrible. It offers less options than Netflix (by far). The free kindle rental offers a wide selection of books you've never heard of before while restricting any popular book series to purchase only. To top it all off the free 2-day shipping has been horrendous. Out of my last 10 orders, 4 of them have not made it by the day they promised. I have called customer service every time and they have simply said, it will be there tomorrow. It's a GUARANTEE. Yet they act like it's no big deal that your shipment isn't going to make it by the time they promised. (Which in reality they typically give themselves a day for processing too so it turns out to be closer to 3 days anyway but it's still late). So unless you plan on buying a fair number of order less than $25 save the money.","December 04, 2015"

Gotta love them for that! The issue I had with them was when I purchased a 12k of pint size Mason Jars. They were shipped in an extra big box with hardly any padding. So when I got the shipment it was obviously shattered to pieces. I called Amazon because I wanted to return it, I didn't want to deal with the mess and I was told that it was a liability for them to get it back from me. But it was ok for ME to get broken glass? I don't think so! So after I talked to the customer service rep and tell him/her about proper ways to ship items they offered me a new shipment of the same item. I was not happy. <<<< Fast forward 2 days later >>>> I get the new shipment in the mail. And yes, it was BROKEN, AGAIN! Shattered to small pieces, made nothing! So again I'm on the phone with someone in customer service who can't really change anything in the warehouse wanted to send me a replacement! I just asked for my money back and called it a day. For an e-commerce company that deals with so many products, they did not a very good job at properly packaging the glass items.

It has everything you want, and I accidentally placed an order and was able to cancel it hassle-free. THIS is what makes a company #1 in its position. Other companies can't seem to understand this, yet are still in business. It blows my mind. But with Amazon, I purchase things with no worries and I know they'll get my items to me. Sometimes they even arrive early, and if there is an issue, they are prompt, proactive and ever-eager to solve the problem. This company is a leader in its space and it's easy to see why. They CARE about their customers as they are the lifeline of their business/company. Bravo, Amazon! I'll be a lifelong customer. As for the reviews section of their site, yeah, a lot of them are fake. But it's not hard to use another site or just google to do more review research.

I have nothing against any other nationality, we are all human beings and must work to make a living. Amazon has every right to employ agents around the world, however they should have those agents assist the country they are from.  It makes for better communications all around.  When a customer cannot understand what an agent is trying to tell them mistakes can happen.  At one point in my conversation the agent said she would cancel my order and then correct the quantity in a new order.  This would delay the product that I purchased. I subscribe to Amazon Prime for the free quick shipping.  The last thing I need is someone changing my order because I couldn't understand what they are saying. Finally, if Amazon were to hire agents in their respective countries it would help the economy in each country and not take it away from another country.

Though it has several benefits, the one promoted heavily is free 2 day shipping on Prime eligible products.  This benefit was really the only benefit of interest for me. It is important to note that Prime eligible products are often a few dollars more expensive than non-prime products.  In essence, they recoupe their two day shipping cost.  The standard shipping cost is generally already built in as the non-prime products are often free ground shipping anyway. My problem is that about half of my orders don't arrive w/in their ""guaranteed"" delivery date timeframe.  In one case an item was supposed to be delivered Saturday and it was delivered Tuesday.  In another case I ordered several items.  One I needed immediately.  On that item I paid for 1-day shipping.  The item was packaged together with my two day shipping items and delivered in two days.  There have been several other instances where items simply weren't delivered in the two day timeframe which Amazon guarantees.  They claim they can't control shippers.   Fine, but that's not my problem. If your service providers can't meet your guaranteed timeline, then you need to compensate members for failing ot meet your guarantee.","June 12, 2015"

This is great for Amazon, they don't have to do anything except transfer an order and collect their percentage of the cut. For the consumer, the plus side of this is that if there is a problem Amazon can serve as a mediator between the customer and reseller.  Unfortunately it usually takes several tries for Amazon's customer service department to grasp the meaning even the simplest complaint.   The consumer can also see reviews and ratings for each third party seller.

Living somewhat far from stores and shopping, it has been really nice to be able to order something I need and having it at my door in two days instead of waiting until I feel like driving the half hour to go pick it up myself. That being said... I have been trying to take advantage of the Prime Instant Video aspect of my membership. On three occasions now (in 6 months) shows or movies that I have been in the middle of, or that I have added to my watch list, went from being free to being an additional charge to watch - within 24 hours time! Imagine marking a movie on Monday night that you were thrilled to have included in your membership only to find out by Tuesday night that you now had to pay. Even worse, imagine watching one episode of a series on Wednesday, that was included in your membership, and turning on the next episode on Thursday to find that it is no longer included.  Amazon seems to be luring you in to their 'perks' only to raise all prices and scam you out of your pennies in other ways.

Looked at questions answered also, stating the door was reversible. I took a minute to search by model number and there was ONE review on this model. The site clumped 13 different models, including outmoded ones, into one set of reviews making the reviews misleading and useless. It arrived in one day - door is no way reversible on THIS EXACT model. Luckily we don't care except I don't like being misled. This is not the first time I've discovered this practice - check out Amazon purchaser reviews of Panasonic NNT-945SF Microwave or Green Mountain Nantucket Blend K-Cups. Reviews are grouped, ALL purchasers of Genius microwaves of any model, ALL flavors of Green Mountain. Useless! Last month we bought a Little Tykes coupe from Quidsi an amazon store, then discovered that the same thing with a trailer was available through Amazon directly. Went to cancel the first one WITHIN FOUR MINUTES and we couldn't because it had ""shipped"". We had to take delivery and return it which cost us $14 UPS. What a scam...  Other than constantly and increasingly dealing with questionable information, if you do research on several websites and don't rely on Amazon to make your decisions, then you know EXACTLY what you want, they are quite amazingly good.","March 20, 2015"

I was really shocked because normally Amazon is all about making the customer's shopping experience enjoyable. At any rate, instead of thanking me for all the tens of thousands of dollars of orders I put through their system (I'm a buyer for our company) they said I was abusing their Amazon prime membership.  Who knew!   At any rate,  Amazon gets almost everything else right - but every so often they do make mistakes. Here are a few I've experienced:  1)Nasty letters sent regarding policy violations (of which we have had none, but that doesn't prevent them from sending nastygrams).   2) Several times, they have posted items for sale which they did not have in stock.  They wont let other sellers do this, but Amazon does this a lot (items that will ship in 30 days or longer somtimes).   This seems rather sneaky.   3)  Items not arriving on time.  If you advertise 2 day business shipping, you should get it to a customer in 2 business days. Several times now my Prime purchases did not arrive on time   Really minor issues, and Amazon continues to be the gold standard for e-commerce. But, they are  worth a mention in case an Amazon exec is ever looking for ways to improve their service :)","February 24, 2015"

The categorization of items makes it easy to find what you’re looking for, and they list customer reviews and satisfaction ratings next to each product. They offer products from many different vendors, and list different options for buying a single item, so you can review different vendors’ prices and customer reviews before making a purchase. The only problem I have had in the past is a long wait to receive some items, but I’ve only had this issue with one vendor. My transactions have always been successfully completed, and I’ve never been charged more than expected. More often than not, my products are delivered more quickly than expected, and have never been received damaged or unusable. I shop on Amazon for pet supplies, books, costumes, gardening supplies, camping supplies, and other things. It is definitely a viable option when purchasing items online.","September 02, 2014"

I never had a problem until Amazon started using USPS. Out of many USPS deliveries only one was delivered on time! Not only that - the Postal Service lies and claims that shipments were delivered a day or two before they actually are. USPS delivery people don't bother making few steps to check whether you are at home and leave notice so that you have to go to the post office to pick up the shipment. This makes Prime a frustrating experience. Teaming up with the USPS was a big mistake, and may end up costing Amazon in a big way.","May 09, 2014"

It is very frustrating to wait this long for 1 item and to not be able to do anything about it except wait.  The message - be careful when shipping items outside US/UK as they pass items on to local post offices who are not always the quickest in the world - which is why we choose amazon to use someone like UPS or Fedex who will actually ship something on time!!

I've had a lot of marketplace sellers advertise products as ""like new"", and 9/10 of the time they aren't, but when I've felt undeniably let down by this form of deception, I've contacted the sellers as required, and 9/10 of the time, they treat me as respectfully as Amazon does, and as for the rest, Amazon has saved the day.  A couple sellers left bad tastes in my mouth.  I usually don't have enough dough to shop directly from Amazon's inventory, but when I have, I've noticed their delivery times are on par with the marketplace sellers', even when you factor in the 3-6 day delay they implement for free Super Save shipping (4 days to ship + 3 days for delivery).

Truth be told Amazon most likely has stock in this company. There is nothing on Amazon about this, until you sell something of course.

What more needs to be said about the online behemoth known as ""Amazon.com?""  It's huge, which means it has a wonderful selection, but despite their size I've had nothing but good experiences with their customer service department.  Sometimes, the subsidiary companies that Amazon works with can be a pain, but in the end Amazon itself has always done right by me.

I recently pre-ordered a videogame from them and when it had failed to arrive by the Monday after release I phoned contacted them, only to hear that I'd have to wait the usual (11?) working days before reporting it lost. Nothing arrived so I complained again, and a replacement was finally sent. In the meantime, because it was a birthday gift, I had to buy a second copy elsewhere (from shopto.net incidentally) which was ordered at 7pm on the Monday and arrived the NEXT morning! FIVE days after the original 11-day wait the replacement arrived from Amazon, and then, a week later what I could only presume was the original order arrived, post dated well after it should have been shipped (it was a pre-order remember?), but before the replacement was posted. This of course I returned which was a simpleprocess that cost me nothing extra but was an unwanted hassle nonetheless. So WHERE had it been? WHY wasn't it posted First Class as I paid for (the time it took to get here I imagine it was sent by Airmail-pigeon post), and WHY couldn't it be tracked? SHOULD this review be on Royal Mails' site? I DON'T KNOW the answers to any of these questions, but I do know that I won't be using Amazon again anytime soon for videogames, no matter what tempting pre-order bonuses they offer.","July 02, 2012"

The only draw back is that product descriptions can sketchy to non existent sometimes and i have had to look up the product else where to get proper information then buy it on amazon. That said they have often been the best priced for items on the net. I have braught many e-books on amazon and find that the selection offered is amazing, but again the product information is very hit and miss. I would prefer a page count or word count as to pay pounds for a 10 page short story is not my idea of value. I have looked at health remedies on amazon but the lack of information has stopped me buying, no in grediets list or stregnth  levels for the product i looked up.","July 02, 2012"

Well at least it seems like it does and if they don't have it you can look for it on another website and add it to your Amazon Wish List and keep track of alll your items you are planning to purchase over time or also allow your family and friends know how to shop for you holidays and special occassions. Our entire family uses Amazon's Wish List browser button and it sure makes shoppping so much easier.,

I enjoy shopping on Amazon, you can find ANYTHING you want, I'm amazed at the large selection of products that you can find. The prices are always competitive, most of the time the best price around the internet. No tax for me in FL plus Free shipping with Prime membership. Prime membership gives you access to movies. Plus the free space in the cloud, the Amazon player, the electronic download for software, very very convenient.  For more savings I use the subscribe and save, again very convenient and unique to Amazon. Overall a great shopping experience. This is why I come back, I order from Amazon almost every week.  Oh and the customer service is so easy to deal with, they will help you in no time and fix whatever issue you might have.

Even their third party vendors provide wonderful service.  Amazon.Com is certainly where it is at! Returns are also a snap!,"May 14, 2012"

They impress me every time. Amazon market place:Essentially one would expect that if you buy it via market place then since it goes through Amazon's engine and has their brand in front of it you'd think they would want to protect this and thus apply pressure to shoddy marketplace practices from some of the retailers. They don't. I bought some headphones, they broke after 3 months, so I requested a return from the company. Initially contact was good, then it all went quiet and I found myself contacting Amazon to request they gave them a bit of a nudge to play ball. Nothing. To cut a long story short, after several attempts with Amazon to get them to earn the cut of the sale that they put through their website I ended up going direct to the manufacturer. They told me that they didn't guarentee anything bought from the marketplace as there were a lot of fakes on there. I asked them to look at my phone anyway and tell me if they were fakes as I would have had far more to go back to Amazon with if they were and pointed out that they were in their first year of service and were guarenteed. Luckily they weren't fakes and they replaced them immediately, but Amazon's halo slipped dramatically for me as a result.  If you want your cut of the money Amazon then sometimes you have to do the dirty work too. If you steer clear of the marketplace then you will never go wrong with the mighty Amazon though.","April 18, 2012"

They arent as cheap as ebay - but you have the Amazon guarantee which you dont with e-bay and thats worth paying a little more for the peace of mind.A tip is that its always worth checking out the Amazon price with free delivery before buying form someone else on Amazon, becasue although there prices may appear cheaper than Amazons, by the time you add on postage Amazon nearly always is cheaper.Customer service is superb.

And I think Amazon have got this down to a fine art. No quibble returns on goods, fast service and always in contact should they think they've not come up to scratch (I've had two emails with money back initiated by them because things have turned up one day late... now that's service!).  Amazon are not always the cheapest, but rarely do I find them expensive, and by the time shipping is factored in (I'm a Prime member, so much is free!!!) they are one of the most cost-effective sites I have found. Backed by their customer service, I find it stress free to buy online... not something that can be said for all online retailers.  The breadth of product offerings is great. I have Amazon Prime because it saves me a lot on shipping. This beats much of the shopping experience on the high street for me... I can check competitiveness of prices, compare brands and sort out delivery all from the comfort of my laptop.  ...and don't even start me on the wonders of Kindle. So many books... so little time. Thanks Amazon... I'm a big fan :)","March 16, 2012"

What started out as a book and DVD obsession for me has turned into practically a retailer for most of my needs.  Shipping and prices are the best overall.  Refunds are almost always troublefree.  Frequent buyers are offered unadvertised specials.  If you write good reviews, you may also be asked to join the ""Vine"" program where you are often offered high-end new products to review. The only items I don't buy from Amazon are cameras and high-end lenses.  For that I shop elsewhere.","March 07, 2012"

The problem with Amazon is that when you have faulty goods or problems they arent always very helpful. I had a hardware fault which was an inherent manufacturer defect but Amazon said i had no rights to claim a repair or replacement from them (They say the Sale of goods act is a load of rubbish) i had to go through the courts in the end to get them to deal with my faulty goods. Also bad if you have to return damaged goods, its at your own expense and in most cases they dont even pay back the cost of your postage charges of recorded delivery so the item is traceable in the mail.Not a good way for a company to work.","February 20, 2012"

My friend started to introduce me with amazon.co.uk to purchase things easily without needing me to go out and buy it. From time to time, i see that the thing which being brought by my friend from Amazon safely arrive on time. So, I decided to go for a try. For the first time in my life, I made a purchase for camera lenses Nikkor 55-200mm from Amazon. After clicking purchase and filling all of the details on my debit card, I suddenly feel bad because I taught that Amazon was a joke and hoax. Few days later, I receive a parcel and it was actually my Lenses !! It was safely arrived and being packed with good and secure condition. Since then, I keep on purchasing item from Amazon and feel that it is much more easier compared to walking to shop. Thank you Amazon :)","February 16, 2012"

Instead they have something which is over complicated and annoying. For example the BIZARRE system they implement with the postage fees and the various levels of sellers which you have to be high up on to be able to even OFFER *free* postage?!,

Should I be looking for high-value items I need to know that the supplier can be trusted to honour their commitments and service promises. Never once have I had a single bad experience or cause for complaint, and for this reason alone I am happy to forego reasonable price fluctuations with occasionally lower prices elsewhere as I know that I'll not be left high-and-dry with a problem. Basically, Amazon have got it right and afford their customers with the consideration and respect that is reflected in their deeds and service policy. For this reason, Amazon will get my preferential loyal custom for as long as their exemplary service continues.","January 29, 2012"

The Marketplace facility is also a great thing.  Generally delivery is very, very quick (i have received some things within 24 hours of ordering with normal delivery), but have had some problems trying to get things sorted when things have gone wrong. My big problem at the moment is my Kindle which failed.  It is a covered under warranty, but because i bought it at Atlanta airport while i was transiting, it has to be replaced in America.  As i don't live there, or have family/friends who do, it has meant having the replacement sent to a friend of a friend who will then send it to me.  Not exactly ideal, and i will still need to pay the costs to have it shipped from the US to Europe.  I also have to pay those costs to have the old one sent back (although i'm assuming these will be reimbursed).  This to me is a ridiculous system for an international company the size of Amazon.  They could easily have sorted it out to be sent to Europe, or be sent from a European warehouse, or even taken up my offer of paying any difference in price between the European model and the US one.  It's all a bit of a farce.","December 12, 2011"

Delivery time is good but P&P for smaller items tends to be higher than the actual postage cost. Some sellers send items as individual packages whereas, if they combined items, this would save on postage and packaging.  As a seller: Amazon's P&P policy seems imbalanced. Small items are overly expensive and larger items, that justify a higher P&P rate, are capped. For one item I sold, because of the P&P capping compared to the actual postage cost, in effect, I gave the book away.","November 20, 2011"

You see, my 2nd Generation Kindle is only 18 months old and is now 2 generations out of date. My wife's Kindle is a 3rd generation and less than 7 months old. I suggested to Amazon, through a web form, that they initiate a buy-back or loyalty credit program to allow 0Kindle owners to upgrade. I was a bit frustrated when I got an email response saying no, apparently from a call center in India. The form asked me if I was satisfied with the response. I clicked ""no"" and within 5 minutes, Amazon called me on my cellphone. I calmly explained my idea and the frustration of the very automated ""no"" response and they took everything I said on board. While they don't have a buy-back program, they gave me 2 x $40 credits to use against new Kindle devices. I should explain that I am an Amazon Prime member and that I do spend a couple of thousand a year between books, e-books, gifts, movies and electronics on Amazon, but they impressed me by responding well and recognizing loyalty.","October 03, 2011"

Amazon's customer service is so fabulous that if I can find the same thing available through amazon or somewhere else, I've often made the choice to purchase on amazon, thanks to its exceptionally reasonable return policies, and the fact that just about anything amazon ships is perfectly packaged and speedily shipped. Amazon now sells some items which are shipped through ""third parties,"" and the same level of consistency in quality packaging, speedy shipping and items being as advertised may not always apply to such third parties. I especially love amazon's product reviews, and it's links to show what other customers often eventually purchase after viewing a particular item, and I love the way amazon makes it easy to quickly find and read both glowing and critical reviews, to ferret out the real scoop on a particular item. Reviews are voted upon, so more detailed and fair-minded reviews are easy to find, and shoppers can fast become well-educated on just about anything and everything. Amazon is also great for internet window shopping!","September 20, 2011"

So it started simple enough good idea, free two day shipping, however movies kind of sucks, they have less than Netflix, but all in all love it for buying my computer parts that I cannot get for less than I get from a company discount(monitors, printers, etc).  My fiancé decided to sign up for the Mom account, this is a quick setup, but what wasn't clear is that this will cancel my prime account. So my prime account was canceled, oh well just get it fixed, so the credited me the difference in shipping cost to my prime account cost. So I called to get this error fixed, and the customer service rep, credited my account the shipping account so I would pay for Prime - credit, which would be fine. This is where the second problem was, so they charged my account the full Prime account cost, so one person set it up wrong? So they decided to credit my account and cancel it, not the best move to get repeat customers. So with that said Amazon 5 stars Prime 3 stars, maybe Prime should model themselves off of Amazon being such a great service! Maybe if they fix this I would recommend them, but not now.","September 15, 2011"

They have almost everything in the known universe, and if you are patient and low maintenance, service is not bad.  I don't think service can ever be better than not bad due to the fact that it is a mall store.  I've sent maybe a dozen inquiries to various vendors and have had one response.  The one response I did receive was that the vendor ""would research and get back to me"" and of course they never did.  And that was regarding an order that never showed up!  Luckily, Amazon does have their A-Z Guarantee.  They did step in and refund my money.   The layout is awful.  Product descriptions are vague and not logically placed.  Most seem like they are updated by mass data feed with little regard for editing or accuracy.  ""Fuzzy"" would be a nice way of describing most of their product images. I have to say they among the best at taking an order.  If I know exactly what I want, I can order from my computer or my phone in seconds.  For browsing and research, forget it.  I'll bet you a nickel it's like that by design to prevent lookey-loo's from tying up bandwith.  Smart, I guess. Aside from Walmart and the IRS, I don't know of any other organization with a worse customer experience but can still continue to get my money.

To the best of my memory, we have never had to contact customer service, and we have never had any bad experiences with Amazon or with anyone who was selling on Amazon.  They seem to be a very well run company.  I realize that not everyone will have such good luck, but their overall record is probably very good.      For $90 a year we get amazon prime, which means we get free two day shipping on most items that are ordered directly from Amazon.  Since we get the free shipping, it is very difficult for other websites (where we usually have to pay shipping) to compete with Amazon.  That is why we end up placing most of our orders with Amazon.  Amazon prime was a smart idea.      What makes shopping on Amazon such a great experience is that alot of people write reveiws of the products on Amazon.  That helps us alot when we make our buying decisions.      I do not recall any bad experiences with the vendors who sell on the Amazon marketplace.   However, some vendors are slower than others.  If you order from an unfamiliar vendor, be prepared to wait.      So far, we have been very satisfied.   Hope they keep up the good work!","November 26, 2010"

I know I have already gotten such a great deal but the price fluctuation made me think I was being cheated. They should have within their policy of price adjustment especially when the price drops within the week of being ordered. Other than that, Amazon is great and it is one of the stores I frequently shop from. They also have free returns on clothing and other select accessories which makes it such a great place to shop from.","November 03, 2010"

When i look at the website it has gone down in price from £390 to £377.I rang amazon, the man on the other line was very helpful he said he will investigate and will give me a replacement. When i mentioned about it has gone down in price so they should give me the price advertise now, he said that the price advertised now is from the third party seller. So they will refund me and it will take 2 weeks before they can return my money. More frustrating because i wanted the laptop immediately that is why i paid for the fast delivery. He arranged for it to be returned via DHL at first he said i should arrange the pick up myself but i insisted he should arrange it that very moment.I still have to wait when my money will be refunded. A very unsatisfied customer","September 22, 2010"

The order always processes quickly and the item(s) always arrive earlier than they say (at least in my experience). The one time I had a problem was when I ordered a textbook from a new user (my/big mistake) and they refused to answer emails. I contacted Amazon and they issued me a refund after the estimated arrival time had passed. Just make sure you use trusted users!,"August 20, 2010"

I have used their website for years, particularly for used books, movies and cds (both school-related and for fun). They often have great deals on their new items as well, making it more cost-effective to buy it brand new for a dollar or two more rather than a used copy. I have also used it to re-sell my old books. Whether as a buyer or seller, the customer service is great. I find using Amazon is MUCH more user-friendly than ebay or other comparable websites.","October 05, 2009"

It was a gift for my dad and he loves it too.  It's great quality and very easy to use.

I have been in contact with customer support a couple of times when the delivery failed because of my own mistakes - in each of those cases Amazon was very friendly and the end result was always positive. Their web-page is perhaps the best among any retailers out there. There are a couple of negative points when shopping at Amazon from Denmark:* Most of the products are unavailable to danes* ""Supersaver"" shipping is never available* Amazon complies stringently with customs regulations which means you have to count in a customs fee that can sometimes be avoided with other online shops I hope all of those points are going to be addressed in the future, with a danish or scandinavian Amazon. All in all though, one of the best shops online.","April 28, 2008"
