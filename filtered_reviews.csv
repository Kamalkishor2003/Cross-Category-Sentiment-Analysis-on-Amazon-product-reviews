The description sounded like an interesting take on a tried and true storyline of girl wolf meets wolf mate--has a few issues, threatened with death, but lives happily ever after.  The different take was that she was mute.  Except she's not mute.  She can speak a bit--ok, there are mute people who are able to articulate somewhat, but our girl can speak with an Alpha voice and force grown, mean, desperate wolves to lay down and show their belly to her.  Yeah, right.Other than a short plot about figuring out she was a wolf--and that took her only a few pages to accept--and a short threatening scene which she handled with that Alpha voice, the rest of the book was about sex.  In fact, I'm pretty sure that was the entire reason the publishing company chose to publish it--as a soft-porn venture with a little, very little, plot thrown in.  The company is Samhain.  They do have an amusing website.  Apparently you can get anything in romance that you desire.  They list categories of romance comedy, contemporary, fantasy, gay-lesbian, historical, horror (I can't imagine a horror romance.),inspirational ????, interracial, suspense, time travel, and western. Everything that is except a well-written book? I plan on checking publishing company names and avoiding anything from them in the future.","02 26, 2010",A17J0MBCTL5J11,P.

So I downloaded the sample, got comfy in my favorite reading spot, and was riveted.  Not because the book was good--it isn't; it is the equivalent of a digital train wreck.  I kept reading, telling myself it had to get better since so many other people loved it.  Right?Oh, so, SO wrong.A reviewer for another book wrote that readers won't have a problem with writing if they just don't expect too much from the writing.  So...the secret to enjoying what we read isn't the author's skill or craft, it's lowered expectations?  Gotcha.Please, do read this book if you don't expect characters, especially the protag, to be developed.  Or sympathetic.  Please read this if you have a loose definition of what makes a hero.  Please read this if you like your female lead to be cursed with Ridiculously Tragic Back Story Syndrome with a dash of Too Stupid to Love disorder.  Please read this if you don't expect too much from a plot:  Abusive, controlling father who is easily fooled by abused daughter who sleeps under her bed to avoid being raped or molested by daddy's drunk friends instead of acting like the grown woman she allegedly is and moving out of unsafe place but who instead goes off to work AND college so she can support his drinking habit yet arranges to spend time with a stranger who sounds crazy but, sheesh, there's just something about him...the English teacher in me demands that I go back and fix that stinker of a sentence, but I won't.  Why, you ask?  Because if you still want to read this book, you'd be better off to just lower your expectations now and get used to such drek.Where have all the editors gone?  Is there anyone left who will proofread material and give constructive advice as to how to fix BAD writing so that we readers no longer need to lower our expectations in order to enjoy what we read?  Is there anybody with reasonable expectations who will say, ""Gee, Dear Author, if people are going to be willing to spend their hard-earned money on your work, the very least you can do is work hard at your craft to earn their money.""Sadly, in this case, the negative reviews are the most accurate.  I am all for trying new authors, but I don't know how many times I have wasted space on my Kindle for this type of bad writing.  From now on I won't bother reading the reviews--they're meaningless, and I won't try any cheap-y bargains in the hopes of discovering a new favorite.

2665,38677,B004GKMPQW,"[11, 13]",1,"This is the story of a detective and his new partner encountering a murder case.  The case becomes something much more than solving a basic murder when details come to light regarding people related to murder victim.  And it becomes an issue of solving more than one case and adding assistance from FBI and Navy.  The premise, while not a new one, has merit.  The specifics are predictible in some parts and there are no real twists to getting to the ""who done it"" and why.  However, that does not mean that many will not enjoy this version.  For many will.  Fans of true suspense crime novels won't find real depth found in other noted authors of same genre (Robb, Grafton, Etc.) - but is a fairly good attempt.The issues lie with presentation (style) moreso than premise.  The novella is riddled with errors related to grammar, punctuation, character development and presence, Point of View, and story arc development.Punctuation:  overuse of exhuberance (!) where illfiting at times, extra floating dialogue quotes at end of paragraph without dialogue, other than dialogue bits (some, not all) incorrectly punctuated, some dialogue missing punctuation related to tags, missing or incorrect punctuation.  Dialogue paragraphs with same speaker punctuated incorrectly (though very few will know such.)Formatting is still a bit of an issue as there are some pages where paragraph breaks are so many only two small paragraphs fit on page.  I do not include format issues in star rating as I know that (at times) formatting is amazon conversion issue from downloaning - rather than writer issue.  However, it appears as if the manuscript was originally typed double spaced and when hitting double return between paragraph breaks (which would then be 4 lines, rather than customary 2) there was an overabundance of spaces.  If that is case a simple full document conversion to single spacing prior to downloading should clear up format issues like that.Grammar:  wrong words used - corn rolls (should be rows) to describe ME hair, make on (should be one) take - there are several such errors - but you get the idea on that.  Past tense and present tense switches in sentences and paragraphs was frequent.  Some may be stylistic choice of writer and happens - but not with such frequency as seen in the work.  Some subject/verbs were not grammatically correct - plural nouns get plural verbs,  etc.POV:  I origionally was going to forgive the first few POV switches as character related fleshing.  But, when the POV for many of the characters switched between third person and first person (in same paragraph) I realized it was author error, NOT character voice.  It is possible to have a character think to self in first while rest of tale told in third - but only if the writer understands the fine line and can convey properly.  In this installment of series (in author defense this is first in series and she may have worked this issue out in later works) the author has no grasp of what POV she is using and how to use properly.  One POV is best for the whole work until such time as skill is developed well enough that conveyance and reading are not stilted for reader.Character issues:  Trace was intergral character and partner in training,  then he just (all but) disappeared about half way through book in order for the ""love"" plot device to develop.  Bob was FBI partner that was there for a blink, disappeared for the same reason as Trace, then popped in near end without adding ANYTHING to storyline.  It would have served better to leave Bob out and just send 1 FBI agent to work case as Bob did nothing but add an inconsistency to story line (detail on that next) .  Press was well developed and Trace fairly so (even though underused)  as was female agent.Inconsistencies:Chapter 11 - Press and Trace left interview with Moira - they climbed in the beater car and drove away...fine, until the reader turns the page and Press puts key in ignition, turns it and gets the smoke plume.Chapter 27 - title states day 4 time:  10 AM - yet the first paragraph has press and agent arriving at house ""that evening.""Chapter 28 - title states day 5 at 9:15 AM - Bob tells Rachel he will be in that night and see her next morning.  However,  he does not show up until day 7, several chapters later.There were more issues related to each listed, but you get idea.  I apologize for length, I write long - though typically not thus much.  However, I viewed a comment by author wherein she stated that a review was not really fair to those reading it (or to her I surmise) without specifics so she could fix errors.  Though some of the word issues and punctuation are not a big deal and frequqntly missed - the gross errors (POV and story arc inconsistencies) should not require reviewer intervention for correction. They should have been caught by writer or her editor as they are glaring.As stated in beginning, many will enjoy this novella. Though predictible and even with errors it is an okay read.  If there were not so many errors, I would have awarded more stars.Christine","07 1, 2012",A30YDY4XKVUBUY,Christine Staeven,Author has good pemise - execution really lacks,1341100800

Unfortunately, this book was a huge disappointment - I had to force myself to finish it.  Many times I stopped reading, went on to another book that I actually enjoyed and then forced myself to go back to it with the hope that it would improve to only be more disappointed.  I just could not get interested in the story or characters.The main characters, Kiran and Logan are really the Norse Gods, Loki and Baldur.  A major problem for me in the first half of the book was that I simply could not keep straight which character was which god and had what supernatural powers.  I have read Federal Tax Laws that were clearer.  While the Norse Gods concept was unique, it was also very confusing to the reader unless one was very knowledgeable about Norse mythology in the first place.  The Norse mythology was also a little too much for such a short novel because it forced the author to find a way to introduce the different Norse Gods, their different powers and relationship to each other which just led to MAJOR bewilderment.  Many times things were not clear until much later in the book when the reader was fed a little more background on the Norse mythology which then made a much prior passage make sense, somewhat, sometimes.  The story might be interesting if reread after a ""cheat sheet"" concerning Norse mythology is made by the reader but quite frankly I still do not think I would be any more interested in the characters or story than I was the first time around.As for the ""hot sex"" scenes that another reviewer mentioned - maybe explicit but that did not make them ""hot"".  To me, the scenes were more of a ""throw in"" because that's what is expected in a book that is supposed to be an erotic romance and I had long stop caring whether there was any romance between the characters.Note to Author:  Please Dana - return back to the Halle Shifter series and let this series stay in the past like Norse mythology.","11 24, 2010",AYZ3XI8VSE6C1,Rare Reviewer,Bypass this series,1290556800

She refuses to acknowledge her own behavior in the fiasco and blames everyone else around her.I know the author was trying for an ""independent and feisty"" heroine, but Jillian veered off that narrow path straight into ""obnoxious and unlikeable.""A reformed rake needs someone worth reforming for, and Jillian - at least in the first part of the book - definitely isn't it.

10409,43504,B004KA9JDK,"[14, 16]",1,"I was going to send a message to the author and tell him I just can't review this book. Then, I went and read the reviews at Goodreads and Amazon (etc.) and I decided some balance was required. Whenever I read a book like this and I read reviews that are not only positive, but have praise specifically for the very things I find worst about the book - I always wonder if they're friends of the author, alternate identities of the author, or people with really low standards in their reading selection.I was 10% into this book and struggling to read further. I made it as far as 27% when I gave up. I just can't force myself to read something this awful. And while I'd really like to get to the surprise ending the other readers have hinted at, I just can't force myself to read any further to get to the big reveal.My first problem is the characters. They're like cartoon characters, the women more than the men. They simply aren't believable. I didn't like any of them and I couldn't relate to any of them. I'm all for damaged characters if their damage makes them interesting, but these characters were so cartoonish they were nothing more than tiresome. I also kept asking myself why this story was populated with the details of characters who seemed to have no impact on the story and do nothing to move the story along. It was difficult enough to maintain an interest in the primary cast of characters without getting distracted by the minor, or even unnecessary, characters.Contributing to the inability to relate to the characters is the second major problem: the dialogue. It's stilted and doesn't flow. Even if the author hadn't told me English was not his first language, I would've guessed. The syntax of the entire book is off, but it's most evident in the dialogue. It's difficult (painful, even) to read.The third problem is the setting. I've been to Medford, OR. I have friends who live in Medford, OR. I don't recognize Medford in this story. I have also worked in hospitals and worked with doctors for over 20 years. The hospital setting and situations were not believable to me. At least when ""House, MD"" and ""Grey's Anatomy"" wander far from reality, the characters are interesting and what they're doing is interesting. The same is not true in ""Promise Me Eternity."" Every time the author took the doctor on detailed rounds, including a description of the patient and what the patient was doing and the conversation with the patient, I kept wondering ""what the hell does this have to do with the story?"" Unless you're a doctor, rounds are boring. And unless a patient is going to play a part in what's going to happen later in the story, the reader doesn't need to know what they look like, what they're doing in the hospital and what they said to the doctor during rounds. Acknowledging that I didn't finish the book, so I don't know whether or not these patients figure later in the story, I can't imagine that every patient in every round is going to play an important part in the whole story.All in all, I was grateful I didn't pay for this book. Even at $0.99, it's not worth it and it's definitely not worth the time.","03 3, 2012",A3GSOAYP4XES3L,"J. Weight ""juliew8""",Unfinishable,1330732800

This seems like a book written by a teenager... a young teenager, but it turns out not to be the case.There are stereotypes galore- i.e. her token black roommate named ""Tyreen"" that says ""mo fo"" a lot. I found that eye-rollingly offensive.Our leading lady- in the midst of a disaster at her college, asks if they will be renting a chalet in Gatlinburg. Her family is supposed to be from Richmond, VA and she is going to school in Tennessee. It's not a chalet down here. It's a cabin. And if serial killers/monsters are taking over your college and killing a bunch of co-eds that look like you, do you really want to go to a cabin in the woods?! Then again, our character is in the lead for the Darwin award.The protagonist, Txema (obligatory exotic name probably looked up on baby name website), is really stupid. There were how many murders in 24-48 hours and she 1) decides to meet her boyfriend after dark at the library across campus instead of him picking her up at her dorm for no apparent reason than she wants to die and 2) she decides that not only her personal safety and that of her beloved roommate is worth less than an iPad and a book. She sneaks past guards put up for the safety of those on campus. When her boyfriend's house is torn to shreds it literally doesn't cross her mind until Tyreen verbally tears her up for not calling the police.She doesn't even care to really find out what her boyfriend's fate was until he is thrust back into her life to knock her up with an audience. She's trying to figure out who she wants to sleep with with literally no regard beyond a ""I wonder if my boyfriend, best friend and her boyfriend were eaten"" (not a quote, more of a paraphrase).This story has (as mentioned before), no character development.

In their search for wives and families of their own, the Beasts have created a pathway between their world and Earth and proceeded to kidnap suitable brides.The plot could have been fine and the typos can be overlooked. The gradual adaptation of the women to a new world and the heroine falling in love could have made for a great story if it had been treated with subtlety.What irked me is the blatant sexism and homophobia that permeated the story. The brides have to be pure (meaning virgins), they are mostly very young (sixteen) and deemed old enough to marry men twice their age. They're kidnapped and kept prisoners until they agree to marry. Those who try to flee back to Earth are punished (worse, the author even makes them like their punishment). There are many references to the fact that the men must be dominant and the women trained to obey and follow. Once kissed, they seem to loose what little reason they were born with and are enthralled with their kidnappers. The only things they require to stay are a) clothes and nice apartments and b)marriage and the wedding night.Homosexual practices are deemed against nature and disgusting.Now, I understand that this might be the view of some readers and I respect that the author has the right to her own beliefs. Unfortunately, it goes against my own beliefs of equality between the sexes and acceptance of all mankind, even those with different taste in their bedroom partners.

10702,38674,B004GKMOYU,"[102, 114]",1,"I have no idea how a book that had such a promising premise and a great set up derailed so incredibly for me as I was reading. And 'derailed' is a good term because I felt like I was 'reading' a slo-mo trainwreck. That sounds hyperbolic and I don't mean it to be. But the story just started to unravel in so many ways for me that until the end I did not like, in any way, a single character in this book.Now, I have read a few of Marie Force's books. Some I've really liked and some that didn't work for me in small ways, but not to an extent that I've actively disliked them. I do enjoy her writing because I think she writes messy stories. By that I mean, she doesn't always color within the lines in a genre that sometimes feel it is one formula after the other. I respect that. But this book simply can't be put in the win column for me.**********SPOILERS GALORE********************THIS REVIEW IS ONE BIG SPOILER************************************First I have to say that every character in the book succumbed to one of two ailments: Big A$$ Whiny Baby syndrome (BAWBS) or Super Self Righteousness-itis (SSR). Not one person remained immune.As I mentioned above the set up and premise is really a good one. Ted Duffy is a pediatric oncologist who comes from a super awesome family and has four of the best friends ever. The guys, Ted, Parker, Smitty and Chip, have all grown up together and have known each other forever. They have a summer house they share and one weekend Smitty brings Caroline, a woman he had been dating for only a few weeks. When Ted and Caroline meet they fall instantly in love. For Ted, Caroline is THE ONE. And he's heartsick that she is Smitty's girl. For Caroline Ted also brought the lightning bolt of love. They part determined to let time and distance remove temptation.I have no issues with love at first sight. I am a believer that people can connect quickly and for real, but honestly I wasn't sold on it here. I thought them both simply saying 'She's the one' and 'he's the one' was too simple. I didn't see it, I was told it. But that is ok. The premise is that they fall in love quickly in order to make it worthwhile when they have to break it to Smitty that they are in love.The second time they meet there is no denying anything and they resolve to be together and work through the pain they must cause everyone. For her part, Caroline plans to break up with Smitty and she and Ted plan to tell him about their attraction. So far so good.But of course things don't work out that way. Smitty overhears them talking and figures out what is going on. And this is where the story begins to run off the rails for me and where Smitty becomes the first to succumb to BAWBS. So he realizes that his girlfriend of 6-weeks and his best friend of 20 years have a thing for each other. Does he confront them? Ask them about it? regroup to think and talk it over with the other friends? No he starts playing childish head games to torture them. And then he picks up his toys and runs to Australia while everyone is so worried about what is going on with Poor Smitty. Never mind that he and Caroline had only been casually dating and that he knew she wasn't as into him as he was to her. No, all this becomes as dramatic as a  Chinese Opera.So now that Caroline and Smitty are done she and Ted are free to pursue each other. They plan to tell the other friends that they are now dating but it doesn't work out quite that way. The other friends find out by accident. And this is where the other guys start to succumb to SSR. How could Ted do this to Smitty? He is ruining 20 years of friendship...blah blah blah.But Ted and Caroline stay strong and are so in love. So in love in fact that within 3-weeks of being together they get married. At this point the train jumps the tracks. Everybody is so outraged that it is almost comical. Even Ted's mother who had been so concerned about her only son's long hours in a high stress job and his lack of personal life doesn't take a moment to think 'hmm, maybe I should get to know this girl who has been the only person my son has shown any real interest in in years' but rather 'how dare you cheat on your best friend with that cheating bitch who is a cheating bitch!!!'So this goes on for some time with everyone giving them the cold shoulder, none of the friends coming to their more formal wedding (they had been married by a justice of the peace earlier). Mind you, no one seems at all concerned about Ted's state of mind, marrying a woman he barely knows, or wondering if she's a gold-digger or anything like that. No everyone is more concerned about how this will all affect poor Smitty. Sure, Ted can be construed a terrible friend for jumping into a relationship with his best friend's ex, but they are all just as terrible for not even trying to understand why he did this. No they are content to just wallow in their SSR.At this point I am rooting hard for Ted and Caroline because, really, everyone else around them are just being jerks. In a real life situation like this, amongst a group of friends, people would be taking sides or some would be neutral not wanting to choose one friend over the other. Some would even be happy for Ted and telling Smitty to suck it up. It's not like Smitty and Caroline were married and she and Ted were sneaking around behind his back. The level of outrage simply didn't fit the perceived crime, imo.So remember how I said I was rooting for Ted and Caroline at this point. Well, that is true until Ted succumbs to BAWBS. After all the 'I love you, no I love you more' and them telling each other it was worth the scorn of family and friends to be together and they pinky swear to stand just the two of them against the world...what does Ted do? Well he decides it is just too hard to live without all his friends around. He can't take their abandonment and censure. So he deserts his wife. Yup. He leaves her. Oh, he still loves her just can't be around her because she was the reason it all went south with his friends and family. So he takes a new job in a whole other state and stops wearing his wedding ring. My reaction at these developments was 'Are you kidding me!?!?' And here the train falls off the tracks completely, down a mountainside.At this point, Caroline is the only one who is still worth anything. I'll give Ms. Force credit, she makes Caroline dig in and try to fight for her marriage. For her this was the real deal and I have to say I felt it and I felt for her.But by now I was so over every single person in this book that the only reason i didn't just close it and get on with my life is because it was so late in the story.The kicker for me is that, guess what? Smitty finds his own true love in Australia and comes back all forgiving. Everything is a-ok now that he knows what love is. We call all be friends again! So now that Ted is back in the fold, he can come back to his wife because they have been formally given the blessing of Smitty. Well isn't that special!I was really hoping that Caroline would tell Ted to just F#&@ off! and then leave him to his precious friends. But she doesn't because she's so happy to have him back and tears up when he puts back on his wedding ring. Aw[...] Not!This book made me ragey. I can't recommend at all.","03 12, 2011",A2GO2DPX0E1NFN,"T. Wheaton ""T.W.""",slo-mo train wreck,1299888000

They are few and far between and hard to find.Since there weren't any reviews I downloaded a sample, it  was lovely, so I bought the book.  It was $5.11 for my Kindle, around average for a FULL LENGTH ebook.  Imagine my suprise when I realized after 20 mins. of reading, I was 60% thru the book!  Nowhere in the book description does it say Novella or Short Story, PLUS the book ends way before 100%(93% approx)they don't give page numbers, sorry non-Kindlers.  That's the only way I can give the book length! So, I paid full book price and got the equivalent of 4-6 chapters.BUT, I think the actual story itself was decent. If it could be expanded upon and made into a full length book, it would be worthy of it's price and I would have given it 4 stars(If it had been a good rewrite of course!)I do think that Amazon should perhaps make it mandatory for authors of books/novellas/short stories under a certain word count to inform their readers of the length of the book.  It's not right to pay for and expect a full length book yet get something entirely different.  EVEN IF the story is cute.  Most of the other stories around this length run from $.99-$1.99.

I've never read a book where I wanted it to end so badly. I finished ONLY because I like to finish books before I critique them.  I don't want to bash the author but I have to be honest here.The plot: Bride-to-be, Shanna finds out by supposed friend, LeToya, that her fiance, Kevin was kissing another man, Ben, on their wedding day.  Shanna runs out on the wedding and  decides to skip town by escaping to an Island where she meet top security guru Ross. They have a one-night stand ( and them some)  and Shanna begins to find contort in Ross. Later, Shanna returns home to find she is being stalked by a mystery person and starts receiving unknown phone calls as well as a robbery to one of her hair salons. She hires Ross to do some investigation and what they discover is a world of lies and betrayal by those who are closest to Shanna.My Take:This book for one, was horribly written. The plot had all the potential to be taken to the next level and failed... miserably. Granted, I understand this is an erotica book, but I was disturbed at how Shanna was able to find what the book described as ""passion"" in Ross not even knowing him for a day! For someone who just found out here fiance might be gay, she took it way to light for my liking.Aside from that, the plot ending up dying because they entire book was about Shanna and Ross having sex. I found myself skipping over several parts just to get back to the point of the story. Instead, of given details, readers are just told what happened. In all honestly, I would have rather had more details than all the sex. And BTW, the sex scene were't even good!!!! Double whammy!Overall I had more problems with the books then likes. Come to think of it, I can't say one thing I did like about the book. Not enough details, too predictable, plot that went south after page 1, and BAD SEX SCENES was just too much for me to bare.This was my first time I've read a book from this author and I'm almost inclined to say it will be my last. However, I like to give authors a couple of tries before I cut them off entirely. I will be skeptical however when I see other books by the author.  I hope she has produces better products because if this is the best she's got, then she will not be writing for much longer.I won't say I don't recommend this book because we all have our own likes and dislikes but don't be surprised if this isn't what you expected after reading it.","10 2, 2010",A1JQH38RSDNEJQ,"primesuspect ""Go, Packers, Go!""",This will go down as one of the worst books I've read,1285977600

It was reminiscent of those old-time movies where the ""feisty"" girl reporter is told not to go into the cellar and of course, the first thing she does is just that. Izzy, told not to go into the woods by just about everyone she meets, does just that too.The characters were not ""fleshed out"" sufficiently for me to have much sympathy for them - we know next to nothing about Feathers, the son, Connor, or his father, Joe (who turns out to be an elf) or the abusive ex-boyfriend/husband/partner. His threats and leaving mutilated animals on her doorstep is not taken very seriously by the police.There is no back story to speak of which would explain the circumstances of Izzy's life - a few letters to her rellies is all the reader gets.

There were just too many creep factors for me, personally, to become that involved in the characters or even to find the love scenes all that erotic (in fact, I found them very bland).  The creep factors were:1. The three men are brothers, which I hadn't expected to be that bothered by but once I started reading I didn't find it intriguing at all or believable.2.  The female protagonist systemically ""corners"" each brother and practically begs for sex from each man in turn.  Just not sexy or romantic.3.  She's 8 months pregnant at the time.4.  They all call the child ""theirs""...he is ""their son""...as in they do not know who fathered the baby and so all claim him. Something about this went against my own peace of mind.  Maybe too...cult-like?  Takes me to number 5...5.  The entire scenario is so unrealistic that even for a book I couldn't suspend my disbelief.  The author writes the 4-way relationship as a pleasant, laid back one, with no jealousy issues or the woman just throwing her hands up and saying ""I need space, quit touching me for one freaking minute"".  All is perfect in their world, nobody minds sharing and they all know each other's business.  And sure, the heroine is well cared and the men genuinely love her, but at the same time she is overly cossetted.

1682,30046,B0046H9ZF4,"[1, 2]",2,"To begin with, let's say that this book is cheap: 2.90$ for 290 pages. And the author knows her English spelling and grammar (no mistake found).I think a lot of people who are not sure they like the idea of &#8203;&#8203;slavery, even consensual, will love this book. But I did not like it.There are several inconsistencies early in the story, so I was not really hooked.* Gavin, the main character, is against slavery, but he works as a trainer of slaves for Cascade, a company that trains and sells slaves.* It is said in the story that Alex (the second protagonist) is the first applicant slave that Gavin trains who really wants to become a slave. His previous slaves in training were young paupers who had not found other ways to get out of their misery than offering themselves as slaves to Cascade. However, Gavin, who is by his own admission, against slavery, trained them all without moral issues. But when he meets Alex, he decides that he is the one he must rescue from slavery and protect him against the kinky owners who want to buy him.* Gavin, who is revolted at the idea of &#8203;&#8203;slave owners who do not take into consideration the needs or desirse of the slaves, takes no account of the firm and deliberate decision of Alex to become a slave. He seeks for 250 pages to discourage Alex from becoming a slave and he refrains from treating Alex as hard as he did previously with the other young slaves that he trained. Which, incidentally, makes the story very dull since the desire of Gavin to go easy with Alex prevents the story from developing interesting BDSM elements.* Gavin treats Alex as if he were a child unable of making his own decisions, but Alex is 47 years old.* When Gavin asks Alex at the beginning of the story how he feels about pain, Alex, who nevertheless met many times sadistic potential buyers before going to register with Cascade, said to be terrified of the pain and not know what he feels about it. And as soon as the first time Gavin strikes him, Alex is supremely excited by what Gavin does to him. How could a forty-seven-year-old guy not realize until then that the pain excited him? Mystery!* Alex--who already knows very well Brian (slave owner) and Rhys (the slave of Brian) to have experienced BDSM scenes with them many times--feels compelled to give his name to Cascade to be able to live that same sort of BDSM things that Brian and Rhys offered him. Why is he not remained free and did he not continued his BDSM relationship with Brian and Rhys if it was sufficiently satisfactory that he wants Brian to buy him? Cascade was absolutely not necessary.Anyway, the story drags on. There is only one real BDSM scene in the 240 pages of the book (because of Gavin desire to ""protect"" Alex and to go gently with him). The main part of the book is a little rough sex scenes. There are too many sex scenes for my taste. So if you are looking for BDSM, just read the last 50 pages, where Gavin finally smartened a bit and decided to show his true nature.Even if the author knows the English grammar pretty well, it does not mean that she is a great author. There is no description of sensations in this novel: no smell, no tactile sensations, no taste. There are very few descriptions of feelings (emotion). We know that Gavin is in love with Alex only because the author shows how possessive he is and that he is nervous at public meetings between Alex and potential buyers.It made me think to a novel that Sade wrote while he was in jail. Nothing in his novel described the sensations either, as Sade could not live what he imagined since he was in jail at that time. Here, the author--a lot less sadistic than Sade (by the way, Sade was a masochist too, his servant dominated him from time to time)--probably did not live much of what she describes as she is unable to attach all the feelings that go with it.In summary, I forced myself to finish this book. But I skipped many pages describing sex scenes and I only browsed several other pages in which the author was only describing the guilty conscience of Gavin and his issues with the idea of &#8203;&#8203;owning a slave (he thinks to buy Alex ). Up to the 7/8 of the book, Gavin still asks Alex if he really wants to become a slave! He had asked him that same question a million times already and the answer was always an enthusiastic ""YES!"". So, I had enough of this mental torture and I read several pages diagonally. I was glad when I eventually got to the last page.I give two stars because of the quality of the writing (no mistake found) and because there is a few good pages (the last 50 pages), but this is the maximum that I can give to this novel.","11 24, 2012",A3BHELCHN1N9YG,Danny,"Cheap, but not so good",1353715200

Good things don't come to those who wait. They're snatched up by those who seize the moment and make it their own and that's exactly what April Taylor and Luis O'Neil were going to do!April had always been a heavy-set girl but hadn't really seen that as a hindrance. It merely was what it was. She had her mother's large hazel eyes and her father's thick chestnut hair, making it obvious to others that she'd be a total knock-out if she could just lose the extra pounds. Thankfully Sylvie, April's best friend, had found a great job for April that would not only take her out of her comfort zone, but would help get April going in the right direction with her life. She soon left Queens and jumped straight into a Manhattan lifestyle! She had lost weight and gained the self-confidence she needed in order to get ahead and go after what she wanted...love. She set her sights on Harald, falling hard and fast. Everything was picture perfect, just as it should be. Unfortunately, her fairytale ending didn't last long and April found herself alone and diving deeper into her bad habits and self-destructive ways. That is, until she went to work for Mr. Luis O'Neil.Luis O'Neil was the son of an Irish father and Puerto Rican mother. He was a handsome and academically gifted child, straying from the expected street life he grew up with. Instead, he focused on achievement, being the best at what he did, and living the American dream! After studying at Princeton he landed himself a job with a major retail corporation, starting off small as a buyer and quickly becoming one of the company's presidents! He had worked hard and it had paid off, giving him all he had ever wanted. Everything but love. Real, secure, unquestionable love. Then he met April.Miss Baehr tells a tale of life, love and what happens when fate interjects. A concept I have always been a fan of, but it didn't quite have the spark and connection to the reader that was needed. April seems to fall in love with any man who so much as smiles at her and her struggles with being overweight are too drawn out and redundant.

If you don't mind uncomfortable settings (war) and circumstances (widowhood, capture & pursuit by the enemy) and relationships that seem destined to go nowhere (regrettable class barriers), then you might enjoy this. It started off nicely, but got steadily gloomier. At about 70%, I gave it up altogether - while it might have had a satisfying ending, by that point I was too discouraged to care.Other reviewers have commented on the similarities to Carla Kelly, but I was disappointed to find the wartime setting was the only thing the novels shared. I absolutely loved Carla Kelly's Marrying the Captain, Royal Marine and Surgeon series. They were gritty portrayals of war as secondary to the romance - yet the romances were heart-warming, uplifting and somehow full of hope. I don't mind angst and tension, but I must feel hopeful. I read for pleasure and this book just struck me as too gloomy. The hero and heroine seemed too willing to accept that they had no future together. Their relationship always focused on imminent separation, so they didn't fully enjoy the present.Just wasn't the book for me, I'm sorry to say.

I was expecting a deep romance with a perceptive, empathic hero and a heroine who had been royally screwed by her fiance and sister.  This book was just rushed and weird.  It was like the author was in a hurry and left out details and wanted to throw way too much into this short book.First, there were alot of things just thrown in and blown over.  I cannot recall if I read what the heroine does for a living.  Also, there was alot of drama surrounding the sister running off with the fiance on the wedding day but there were no details given about the sisters' relationship before the incident.  There is the mention of a few other visitors and employees at the dude ranch but they are all glossed over. There is another man interested in thd heroine briefly.  He is given about 2 pages.  There is very little character development and I did not care about any of these people.  Even the sex scenes were skimpy and rushed.When the heroine goes to the ranch, there is a little drama with another woman who is chasing the hero but even this was confusing.  It was really not necessary to the story and the drama was not fully developed.  Just thrown in here and there almost like an after thought.Also, the heroine spends the first part of the book disliking the hero just because he was handsome and she was attracted to him, I think.  Not really sure why.  He spends all his time telling her he knows she does not like him.  That is the extent of his perceptive empath abilities.The secret is frankly, stupid.  I won't give it away but I guessed it pretty early.  I was hoping I was wrong because it really did not fit in with the story.  When it finally came out, even the reveal was less than satisfactory.  I cannot say more without spoiling this.The interracial aspect of this novel was non-existent.  There was a BRIEF mention of race and that was all.  These people could have been blue for all race mattered.The ending was a complete rushed cop out.  It really felt like the author realized ""oh yeah, I need to write a last chapter"" so she did so without any real buildup.  If you cared about the characters (which I did not), you would feel cheated by how fast their ""conflict"" was resolved and how.Two stars because this author has done better and she did make the effort to write this book.

456,10389,B0031W1EJ0,"[35, 39]",2,"Wow, okay, I sense an Amazon.com equivalent of an egging or a TP party coming on, because if I am to honestly review Demonfire, it's not going to be NEARLY as flattering as the majority of other reviewers. Paranormal romance and urban fantasy are my two favorite book genres. I read and I review a lot of them. I've come to realize that I'm usually pretty forgiving of minor issues or singular issues - for example, if it's a decent story but not technically all that well told, I may give it a three stars, but explain in my review what the critical aspects are. I understand and accept that I hold my favorite genres to a higher standard - rightly or wrongly - than other genres and that ultimately I want to be entertained. I believe that if I'm not entertained given that the genre predisposes me to being entertained, then there's a big problem somewhere.I was NOT entertained by Demonfire.My apologies to Kate Douglas, who I've enjoyed as an erotic paranormal romance author, but frankly, I found the characters in Demonfire to be two-dimensional and the narrative to be repetitive, inexplicable, and at times heavy-handed. Eddy and Dax seemed cardboard and flat, and unfortunately, so did the entire impetus behind their relationship. The abrupt way they were thrown together felt too contrived and put a heavy strain on my suspension of disbelief (not even Dax could understand how he got into Eddy's shed from the portal he came through, so how could I?). When those issues combined with the perplexing mythology of the Lemurians to explain Altan's character and presence, the first quarter of the book felt like a cross between a snore and a quagmire of implausibility. To be honest, the pitbull/poodle mixed-breed canine was more fleshed out with a more believable and sympathetic backstory than two thirds of the book's main characters, and that's a problem.Dax is a former demon (now reincarnated/reanimated/newly de-demonized-sorta/former soldier boy) with a tattoo on his body that will come back to bite him...or try to again and again and again. Eddy is a human reporter who is willing to toss her job and fight demons she didn't even believe in yesterday. No convincing and little to no explanation needed. She finds out her touch soothes Dax's demonic curse...with no explanation and little to no coherent reason given. Altan is the ancient Lemurian who gave up his millennia-old and immortal life in the caverns of a currently inactive volcano (or other dimension...I wasn't too clear on that - could be both, I suppose, though I'm not sure why the volcano would exist in both dimensions). The parts of the story concerning that race and Altan's decision was anorexic in plot and very nebulous in the narrative, and I had a big problem with Altan's excellent grasp of modern American vernacular, technology, and cultural references, considering the written mythology. Toss in the dog Bumper, a will-o'-wisp tinkerbell-sort Willow (my favorite character through most of the book), and Ed, Eddy's father (by far the most interesting and believable character) and you have the core group that fights the big bad demons...who really aren't so big or bad, given that they're animating garden gnomes and other kitschy lawn statuary...except for the gargoyle - but you'll have to read THAT for yourself.The problems with the book aren't just in the characters. The world Douglas is trying to create here never really snapped into solid focus for me. Too many shifting descriptives and inexplicable happenstance. The book's main conflict, the threats of the big bad and smaller baddies was bizarrely non-threatening (you could've had a ""no humans were hurt during the writing of this book"" disclaimer). And then there was the repetition.Dax was given a human (sorta) body for one week to fight the demons slipping from Abyss. After the protagonists get together, the book counts down the rest of Dax's seven days and at some point in each one of those remaining days the fact he's only got six... five... four... three... two days left is given a lot of room in the story to explain in mind-numbing detail just how sucky it is for all concerned that Dax only has that much time left. And this melodrama went on each and every day, over and over and over again. Repetitively.I don't think that's compelling plot, nor do I feel that it engenders any sense of true tension, because as the reader I know going IN that it's a paranormal romance and Dax and Eddy are going to get their HEA. Otherwise it'd be called SHAKESPEARE. Lamenting for page after page about them being separated for eternity just becomes tedious and (dare I be repetitive?) repetitive. I've read excellent paranormal romance series that deal with this subject and it's always the ingenuity and originality of HOW the leads get their HEA that impresses me. I already KNOW they're going to. So by the end, when I was at least hoping for a glimmer of originality in the WAY Eddy and Dax stay together, I was ultimately disappointed again. I won't give spoilers...but it was just...not well done.So why the two stars, given how much it sounds like I hated it? Because I DIDN'T hate it. Maybe I was too ambivalent about it to hate it. Maybe that's worse. But mostly the two stars are because there were a few tiny glimmers of hope. Kate Douglas does write reasonably sensual sex scenes, and what little chemistry there was between Dax and Eddy shined brightest during them. I think it's hard sometimes to go from writing erotic novels to toning down the sex for a mass market audience, and I think that Demonfire was well represented in that regard. I think some people are going to think it was TOO graphic or explicit, but I'm not one of them. I also sort of ended up liking Altan. I still don't get why he talked in such a modern and culturally human fashion, but I thought he was sort of endearing with the sword that refused to speak to him and the crush he gets on Ginny. And THAT is why I will give Kate Douglas another chance. The second book in this series is due out later this year, and according to the sneak peak, Altan is off to Sedona where he sent Ginny to save her from what was going on...only to get a call that things in Sedona are even worse, as live animals are being possessed by demons and attacking their owners and neighbors and the like. And Ginny is stubbornly aware of Altan's machinations with mind control, despite Altan's best efforts. I think it sounds fun. And Ginny, for her few minutes of face time in the book, struck me as a more layered and spunky character than Eddy ever did. I'm looking forward to reading about them. We'll see.","03 9, 2010",A2E9HDZXQORZLA,"Tracy ""One Good Book Deserves Another""",Didn't Work for Me at ALL,1268092800

I understand ""The Chosen Soul"" was HKW's first book written some 10 years ago, and that it was revised by the author after reading some of the reviews.  Well, I think it might have needed a second revision.First off, let me say the author writes very well in general.  She also is highly imaginative and her action/battle scenes are exciting. As I'm still fairly new to the Fantasy Genre, it did take me a few chapters to immerse myself in the world setting.  As in ""Hell Bent"" I felt the situations were reasonably complex and the characters numerous.  It took me a while to sort everything and everyone out.  In fact, by the 40% mark (no page numbers on Kindle) I found myself growing confused about the three male love interests, mixing them up to such an extent that I had to go back to re-establish their identities.  They were all wonderfully handsome, had numerous magical powers, hypnotic eyes and all of them fell heavily for Raven/Winter.  That became a problem for me as the story progressed.  I got a little tired of all the handsome men wanting her so badly.The next problem for me was our heroine, Raven/Winter, herself.  She was kinda wimpy right up to the very end of the book.  I'm sure that finding out your father is a devil would be a shock, as would realizing you have demonic powers of your own.  But when your life, or those of your loved ones are threatened repeatedly (and I do mean, repeatedly, as in everyone is out to kidnap or rape you over and over again), then own those powers and use them to save yourself, woman!  Can't just stand on those exceptional good looks.Full points for the many great plot twists.  However, at one crucial point about 60-70% along, I must have been distracted and missed an important point.....that Cruor was Gray Beard!  Boy, I felt dumb over that one when I had to go back a few chapters to sort it out.  It threw me off that the character was called by both names later on in the narrative.On the whole, the plot was a little disjointed, but the individual plot ideas & inventions were interesting and imaginative.  I liked some of the characters a lot, like Loki and Abonides.  I found the names a little bit difficult at first but got used to it by the end.Perhaps, ultimately a bit dark in tone, and I do agree with other reviewers that the novel ended abruptly, like ""time to wrap this up now and finish up in a sequel some day"".  Raven/Winter didn't win points by resigning herself to life with the Elven Prince, but I guess she was just being practical since Drake was gone.  She was probably tired after fighting off all her abductors and needed a good rest.I will be reading the author's other books as I bought them all, they were such a good price.

The baby's momma shows up, but doesn't cause any trouble, the exboyfriend-ish has no hard feelings, and there's no negative ramifications for the gay cowboys.The biggest conflict was the baby's fever and the guys getting over themselves, and even that didn't seem like such a big problem since the supposedly straight dude hopped right over that hurdle.There was nothing I hated about this book, but there's very little I remember about it either. Parts of it were cute, and it would work as a series of vignettes, but as a novel it didn&#8217;t hold up.I may have enjoyed this story more if I&#8217;d read the first of the Sylvan series, but since the characters in that didn&#8217;t play too major of a role, I didn&#8217;t feel lost.","05 24, 2014",AAW8KJYQJMPQT,Alex W,Stars: 1.5/5,1400889600

He takes double doses of his medicine and other drugs to feel better.  Much of the time he is incompetent because he is in a haze.  You'd think that since he's been seeing ghosts for most of his life, he'd be used to it and have ways to deal with it.  But no, he's freaking out all the time trying to run away from every ghost he sees.  The reason he's a psycop is because he can talk to ghosts.  I was disappointed that he didn't use that skill in either of the first two books.  But to be fair he does talk to one or two ghosts briefly in each book - but not related to solving a case.Second, in addition to running away from ghosts, he runs away from people - his friends, his acquaintances, his lover.  He buys crystals to help him with a problem, but then he runs away from the guy without knowing how to use them.  Later he must return to the guy to ask how to use the crystals.  A ghost tells him how (which may or may not be true), so Vic runs away from the guy again without getting instructions.  When others ask Vic how things are, he lies and says fine so they will go away and leave him alone.  This did not interest me.  It frustrated me.  Experts say ""don't write about wimps.""  I agree.  Vic is a wimp.Vic leaves his phone turned off, so when friends try to reach him, they can't.  He intends to tell Jacob (his lover) about a problem, but he wimps out and doesn't tell him.  When Jacob starts to talk about something, Vic says ""Do we have to talk about it right this second?""  Again, running away.Later when some bad guys are caught and the cops are asking Vic for details, Vic doesn't tell them that the bad guys have other safe houses.  I did not like his reason.  Some might say the reason was stupid.  Others might say he had a believable motive for keeping the secret, but he didn't act on it.  So his lying to the cops was for nothing.I really liked the relationship with Jacob.  It's hot.  Jacob is so intense and into Vic.  It's too bad the surrounding story was weak.DATA:Narrative mode: first person Vic.  Kindle count story length: 2078 (314 KB).  Swearing language: strong, including religious swear words.

It had the possibility to be pretty good but the execution wasn't there.First of all it seemed like the author just took a little bit of vampire lore from every vampire story there is.  Which wouldn't be bad in itself, except that I felt like it was almost a parody at times.  Kinda like that movie ""Vampire's Suck"" that makes fun of all the vampire movies.I REALLY, really, really, did not like the ""heroine"" of this story.  I don't even like calling her that. She had no depth, and was a spoiled, self-centered, vapid young girl.  She had no brains, and might as well have walked around with a sign on her neck saying, ""Here I am come kill me!""  Her character is really what made this book awful.Here's the story:Brian is a vampire and lives across the street from ""the girl of his dreams"".  (I think this exact phrase was used at least 10 times in the story, although I really think it must have been nightmares!)  Besides the usual vampire powers (strength, speed, agility, and mind control) he can dream walk and spirit walk.  He's pretty obsessed with Heather (the girl across the street).  He basically stalks her dreams and follows her around in a spirit walk.  The book starts off where he is spirit walking and follows her to an abandoned home where she and her friends like to party.  Heather leaves the party just as men in suits come to haul all of her friends off.  (We don't know where.)  Brian ""suggests"" that Heather come to his house so that he can keep her safe.  Their journey begins as they try to escape the mysterious agents who have been tracking them down.  The weird thing is that they aren't after Brian (because he's a vampire), they are actually after Heather (although I don't know why, she could make anyone want to just gag her and put her in the trunk).I felt like Brian was a pretty accurate description of a teenage boy- hungry all the time and thinking about sex when he wasn't eating.  I really never understood what he saw in Heather except that she was beautiful.  (Which again, would be true to form for a teenage boy).This is not something I would want my pre-teen daughter to read, because of the way that the female lead was portrayed and some mild sexual content.","03 8, 2011",A1JJ4O649OQNXS,"C.K.

Nissa, a 29-year-old barmaid, is walking down the street kicking rubble out of her way and making sure that her ""stunstick,"" a personal defense weapon, is close at hand.  Sound intriguing?  Well, let it go, because after that short glimpse of a future world, the rest of the story could literally be set anytime, anywhere.  Nissa hooks up with two vampires at a vampire recreation club.  They're a good fit for each other as they're all beautiful, completely uninterested in the world around them, and obsessed with sex.I mean, I expect sex in a vampire erotic novel.  I WELCOME it.  But what is the point of creating this whole future world and not doing anything with it?  The main characters are completely ahistorical - they could exist in 1869 or 2012 or 2069.  They don't seem marked by the obviously turbulent events of the future.  Poverty is wide-spread, but apparently vampires don't have to worry about it.  At one point, the heroine was lying in bed and realized she didn't remember the last time she'd had clothes on.  That's how boring it is.

But for me, certain little and not-so-little things snowballed to the point where cumulatively, it killed whatever good parts there were to the story.MEMORABLE QUOTE: ""To tell the truth of it my lord, aren't all men basically the same under their breeches no matter from whence they hail?""A closet fan of (non-Regency) historical romances and unfamiliar with Theresa Meyers, I had high hopes for ""The Spellbound Bride"" based on the blurb, the reviews and per the author, ""over two years of research"". However, after struggling to the finish, I felt as if I had read a book different from some other reviewers. It bothered me on so many levels, I actually felt insulted.Apologies in advance if this review seems harsh but in order to justify the 1-star rating (a very rare personal rating), I have to touch on areas that I generally avoid (partly to suppress my personal preferences but mostly out of recognition of the hard work writers put into their stories).  Another personal dislike but... MINOR SPOILERS ahead.(1) CHARACTER/PLOT POINTS--HUH? I willingly suspend disbelief and critical thinking in order to enjoy fiction but sometimes, certain things are so jarringly wrong that they leap out and smack me in the face.  Occur early enough in the the story and my continued reading is forever tainted. Four major ""smack"" moments (without giving too much away):-- heroine's belief in being ""cursed by some dark deadly poison that dwelt insider [sic] her""... despite numerous NOTES left behind after incidents;-- heroine so skilled/knowledgeable, she brewed sleeping potions for her ""da""... at AGE 4;-- Archibald is the 14-year-old Earl of Argyll yet on a trip, only Ian and Sorcha travel with him (around a storyline so implausible that I was rolling my eyes); and-- apparent (lack of) passage of time in the second half of the book yet the heroine already had a ""slight swell""???(2) UM, WRITING STYLE? I can generally look beyond most writing styles but I simply couldn't understand the rationale behind splitting the speaker with the person's dialogue into separate paragraphs (ie, 1st sentence/paragraph is ""He frowned."" Next sentence/paragraph is the person's dialogue).Also, the one- or two-sentence narrative paragraphs became annoying. Maybe I'm old-fashioned but I expect such short paragraphs to be limited to crucial thoughts, information or turning points; too many and it becomes almost stream of consciousness, lacking cohesion and/or transitional writing skills. (At first, I though the foregoing was due to formatting/download error but nope, appeared throughout in parts to the end.  The wasted space (resulting in many more pages to turn) then made me think of ""Kindle abuse"".)Lastly, get a little too fancy with imagery and it can lead to output such as:""...an edge to his voice that was filled with both unsympathetic cold and hot anger..."" (I still can't figure this out)and ""...concern marring the dark trusting line of her brows..."" (what does a trusting browline look like?)As a reader, I don't want to be distracted like this. This is not Nietzsche, for goodness sakes!(3) HISTORICAL CONTEXT? This is the least of my problems with this book. I don't give a fig about historical accuracy so long as deviating from it serves some purpose (case in point: love ""Braveheart"" despite its utter trashing of historical facts).  However, given the author's long research in contrast to the actual amount of historical background incorporated into the story, I couldn't resist looking up the North Berwick witch trials after finishing this book.The story begins in 1593 but the actual witch trials occurred from 1590 to 1592. Also, King James VI married Princess Anne in 1589 but the story refers to her as a ""new bride"". I hate to say it but unless there was a typo in the prologue's dateline, I read nothing in the story that warranted using the later date of 1593.  Such a tiny, simple thing but that alone rendered the historical aspects of the story incongruous.This final point is truly just me and my upbringing. I try to give as much leeway as I can when foreign phrases pop up in books.  But sometimes... FYI, the first known use of the term ""tte-&agrave;-tte"" was in 1696. Could it have been in use before that?  Absolutely. 100 years before? Not likely.

The Character's aren't consistent and neither is the plot. Here are my problems with it:1. Jasmine (the heroine) she starts off seeming strong and independent. Then becomes immature at times and even submissive and sometimes flaky. Then she's back to acting strong again. She keeps flip-flopping from one way of thinking and acting to another.2. Keilan (her love interest) starts off seeming concerned about scaring her and not wanting to harm her in the beginning. He then turns into a dominating molester within the next chapter or so. He again becomes a sweet romantic love interest halfway in the book then dominating again. It's very confusing who these people are and what they are about. There were many other characters mentioned but you barely know them or understand where they are coming from either.3.The genre didn't seem to fit what was actually in the book. Yes there is some romance, there is fantasy/sci fi but there is also erotica in the book. I wish the author picked a genre and just went with it instead of tried to blend so many in one. She goes into descriptions of each in different scenes but the tone and feel of each scene doesn't always feel like the same book. Primarily the sexual aspects seemed really obscured compared to the rest of the book. I wish she would of just chose Full erotic novel OR Full romantic novel. Neither aspects seemed to blend together or stayed consistent in this book. Also the sexual aspects were so few and far between in the first half of the book that it seemed out of place.4. OK so the book is about a girl with Charmer abilities (can seduce shifter men with her scent basically) who happens to be best friends with a shifter princess. Why should we, as the reader, care about this and what does it have to do with the story itself? I'm not sure about that answer. Again if this was a full erotic novel some of the sexual themes and her seductive powers would make more sense. Like the sexy clothing and underwear in the beginning, is suddenly forgotten after the first &#34;molesting scene&#34; then she's able to wear dresses and regular shirts and pants. What was the point of that?? And a scene where an aphrodisiac was used then backfired to cause a loss of sex drive just didn't fit in. But since this is a romantic/action/fantasy I think?? I'm not sure why we should care or where the author was taking us with all this. Or why so many things were mention just to be resolved and forgotten about within a page or so later.So in a nutshell, there were things about it I liked. Things I didn't like and things that just didn't make sense to me. There were a lot of scenes and characters that could have been cut from this book to give it a more focused feel and shorten it. I hope the author chooses to rework this one and give it  more structure. She had a lot of cool ideas and interesting world she created but I feel her story needs more planing.

If your a fan of forced seduction then this book will work for you. I did not enjoy it. To close to rape for my liking.Unlike the first book Ral&#8217;s Woman where Ral shows a genuine affection and protective concern for his human, Argernon dose not show these qualities for Casey until much much later in the book. Argernon is entirely shellfish and demands that Casey stay; because he can&#8217;t live without her. He gives her no choice. The same seduction techniques that Argernon uses are just like her ex who was trying to forcer her, and she should have told Argernon and he should have backed off and gotten to know her without the bondage. It felt like a broken record with the seduction your body wants me ergo your heart does too. Around 30% into the book we get some action outside the bedroom which was a change, but other then that it&#8217;s all about Argernon not letting Casey go.If you like to read a series in order then I recommend this book, but in general if your into overbearing alien men who don&#8217;t have a clue about women&#8217;s rights and like to use sex as a weapon to get what they want then you&#8217;ll like this, otherwise I would not recommend this one.","03 28, 2014",A3ANLUEKJBC1IZ,"Angela @ Angel's Guilty Pleasures ""Angel's Gu...",Review Kidnapping Casey,1395964800

You're not going to deflect a 12-foot hill giant's club the size of a punching bag with a sword, even if it is to ""make contact"".  You're not going to recommend gathering intelligence on the enemy, then sit on your butt for two days in the fort waiting for them to besiege you.

I found this particular one to be unfulfilling, both from the standpoint of the mystery, and in its depiction of the characters.  Also, I would have appreciated it if it had been made clear in the blurb that this is Christian fiction - at least, I thought it so  since anytime the plot was starting to build up any hint of momentum, the two protagonists would stop and quote scripture at each other.  (If the Bible had copyright issues, this book would have lost pages in length.)The female protagonist earned her title of ""limp"" from me because she falls for a man based on the fact that he bears a surface resemblance to her imaginings of Lord Peter Wimsey, and she convinces herself it's a forever thing after a couple of strolls and a kiss.  There are sheltered thirteen-year-olds with more romantic sophistication than this.The male protagonist earns his ""limp"" status because he keeps proposing to the limp heroine, even after multiple rejections, yet doesn't actually do anything to present his case or win her over.  Probably this is intended to show his faithfulness and humility, but this is the kind of nice guy who finishes last in the real world.  And early on in the story, he responds to something the heroine tells him by saying ""Yes, mother.""  Not romantic.  Not sexy.

The characters were very unique and well developed, and the plot was definitely solid, two of the many reasons that the book took off as soon as I started reading.

5343,9526,B0030CMLR0,"[0, 0]",4,"I've read two books recently with a blind hero/heroine, so I thought it would be interesting to contrast this book with Mary Balogh's The Arrangement and Gayle Callen's Surrender to the Earl. Both of those were 3.5 stars for me, but I'm giving this one a full four stars.All three books did very creditable jobs portraying the difficulties faced by a blind person in early the 19th century, particularly the nagging, yet sometimes unrealistic, desire for more independence. But Joanna Waugh's depiction of Lady Fortuna Morley's life was especially evocative. Lady Fortuna's cousin Letty is her constant companion, but at a house party Lord Granville pairs Fortuna with his Irish wolfhound, and the dog becomes her guide. One morning she takes the hound out into the garden and sits down while he attends to business.""She couldn't remember the last time she'd been so utterly alone. It felt like heaven not to have Letty or one of the servants hovering nearby. If only Papa could be convinced to release some of her income, she could purchase a cottage with a garden like this one. A place in which to enjoy precious solitude like an ordinary person.""But that aloneness isn't always so wonderful, such as when Fortuna is in her bedroom at an inn and hears noises in the parlor. She panics, thinking that someone has broken in, only to realize shortly that it's Lord Granville. Nevertheless, ""She'd never felt so alone, or so vulnerable.""As described in the blurb, the plot is a battle of wills between Fortuna and Lord Granville, who is courting Fortuna's silly young cousin Felicity. Fortuna knows Granville to be arrogant, cold, and heartless, and tries without success to dissuade her cousin from entering into the marriage. Felicity, however, sees only a handsome, rich marquess who can elevate her status and fulfill her every desire. Fortuna is her opposite -- a devotee of Mary Wollstonecraft, she does not aspire to marriage, even though her handsome dowry likely could have attracted some gentleman willing to take on a blind wife.Granville is indeed arrogant, cold, and heartless, at least on the surface, and he keeps his finer qualities well hidden. Very well hidden. He is not one of those dark heroes who suddenly becomes wonderful. He is unwillingly intrigued by Fortuna, but that doesn't mean that he's nice to her. And at times, even when he's trying to be nice, he inadvertently insults her.In addition to the strong, resourceful heroine, and the intriguing hero, there is a fully developed cast of secondary characters who contribute to the overall richness of the plot. Toward the end, however, there were two things that kept this from being a five-star read for me. I won't describe them, as it would be too spoilerish.This is Joanna Waugh's only book, and it was published five years ago. I hope she's planning to write more, however, for she is an excellent writer with a thorough grasp of the manners and customs of the Regency period. (Although -- she does flub her titles occasionally when she refers to Lady Fortuna, an earl's daughter, as Lady Morley. Grrr.) The pacing, plot, and characterization of this book were all first-rate. In addition, she has ""illustrated"" her book with a beautiful Pinterest board ([...] showing people, houses, furniture, artwork, gardens, and other scenes from her book.

1236,2170,B001DOHZ5A,"[2, 2]",4,"Reviewed by ANN & posted at Under the Covers Book BlogBORDER LAIR is the second book in the Dragon Knights series. While I do believe that this book is strong as a standalone, Adora and Jared are introduced in MAIDEN FLIGHT and their romance really stems from there. This book takes on a different approach than the first book. I thought D'Arc really changed the tone of the series with this one. Things are far more bigger in this book - war is approaching and dark times are ahead.Unfortunately for Jared, his life has been in constant darkness since his wife and child died. His grief still lingers within him and he feels unworthy of Adora's love even though she is willing to give it freely. He deems himself undeserving and I think readers will be touched by Jared's gentle heart. Adora gentle coxes Jared out of his shell and slowly learns his ways. As their romance continues to bloom D'Arc really cements the fact that they are meant to be together, a third member is introduced. Lord Darian comes to warn them that death and destruction come their way and though he is seen as a traitor now, Jared welcomes his old friend. Darian takes an immediate interest in Adora and sparks fly between the two. However, as Darian is a member of the royal line of black dragons, Adora is aware that she cannot have something permanent with Darian even though she desperately wants to.D'Arc experiments with the mating rules and rituals she introduced in the first book and I liked seeing the happy ending at the end, but felt that the solution to the conflict seemed to happen too conveniently. I also felt that the romance was slightly impeded by Jared's hesitancy and seemed to fast-track too quickly after when he made the decision to be with Adora to make up for the time lost. Nevertheless, I was enraptured by D'Arc's world. Bringing together dragons, war and love, D'Arc is readily able to transport readers to another time, giving them an escape that they will sure to remember.The se x scenes, again, are very explicit but are well-done. D'Arc explores light bondage and m&eacute;na ge well and am always looking forward to seeing how she will bring three different people together for the purpose of love.

The only thing that you can be sure of is that whatever surprises she has in store, they will be entertaining. Lover Enslaved was definitely no exception.It should be no surprise that the characters are what made this book so much fun. They were witty, fun, just the right amount of snarky and the supporting characters were just as much fun as Dash and Mara. Of course there were some serious moments too. Both of these characters had been through a lot and they both had their own share of secrets. During the course of this story they both discovered as much about themselves as they did about each other.The bad guys were despicable, the humor was as smart as it was funny, the characters had depth and there was just enough action to keep everyone happy. I also have to mention that I can't remember the last time I read a book by Jodi Redford that had quite this much *ahem* tension. By the end of the book I actually felt sorry for Dash.

6185,8209,B002V1H2ES,"[5, 5]",4,"Warning: This review might contain what some people consider SPOILERS.Rating: 8/10PROS:- This story is a nice progression from the one before it (Bound by Deception). The characters' personalities are consistent between stories but have evolved as a result of their relationship, and Oliver and Vincent struggle with the sorts of problems I would expect to have arisen in the past 6 months since they first got together.- Oliver's situation is quite sad. He's in love with a man (a hanging offense), he's almost destitute (for a gentleman, anyway), he's the son of a man with a terrible reputation for excessive gambling, and Vincent treats him with very little emotional affection the majority of the time. Yet he doesn't allow himself to wallow in self-pity, and I like that about him.- The sex scenes are hot, with a touch of BDSM. It's interesting reading about sex toys from 1830s England. I don't have any idea whether they're realistic or not, but I'm sure the author did some research before including them.- I liked the ending quite a bit. It mentions the *possibility* of unhappiness in the future, but given the time frame of the story, it's as happy as it can realistically be.CONS:- Much of the story is sad in a hopeless, ""I'll never have what I want from life"" sort of way. (Once again, though, happy ending...)- I got super annoyed with Vincent's treatment of Oliver and with the fact that Oliver puts up with it for so long. Vincent treats Oliver basically like a prostitute for the majority of the story: he uses Oliver for sex and then leaves so he can get back to his uber-important, aristocratic life. He insults Oliver over and over again, and Oliver is so whipped that he simply takes it. I did get an idea of WHY Vincent is such a jerk sometimes, but his selfishness took a lot of the romance out of the story for me.Overall comments: I liked this story overall: it's well written and contains a few decently graphic sex scenes--which, with the inclusion of bondage and light pain games, are unusual for a Regency story. The story is about 75% angst, though: it has a good ending, I think, but the majority of the journey to get TO that ending is a little rough.","08 22, 2010",A3O9A7B0KJO88B,Charly T.

After a desperate escape from Alan Matthews, his former ruthless pack Alpha, Dylan just wants to fix up a house and live peacefully in Red Rock.Sasha Wallace is a witch. Her mentor was killed by Matthews because Matthews wanted Sasha for himself. Before she was rescued however, Matthews inflicted scars both physical and mental, and those take a long time to heal. Sasha knows things could have been much worse and feels she owes a debt to the Red Rock Pack for rescuing her.When a werewolf comes back into town showing evidence of a vampire attack, the Red Rock Alpha decides to send Dylan and Sasha to Maine to call in a debt from a friend - a vampire friend. While Dylan and Sasha meet with the vampire, their pack-mates, Joe and Brynn, are tasked with checking out the local werewolf pack, as there have been hints of trouble. Little do they know what kind of trouble is waiting for them. I liked the fact that we get to see how Brynn is progressing since the end of Sanctuary Lost.

Their insecurities were realistic and the potential conflicts resulting from their issues made for believable characters. Dylan is not Alpha but his werewolf instincts were very, very sexy.

I'm glad I also have the Shambhala book, because some of the typos in this Kindle book make it at times a real head scratcher.  Here are some of the funnier ones:* Through the weakening of the causes of bondage, and by learning the method of sassing, the consciousness is transferred to the other body.* Vestures of consciousness are built up in conformity with the Boston of the feeling of selfhood.* In the internals of the batik, other thoughts will arise, through the impressions of the dynamic mind-images.I'm glad I had the Hartranft version to be able to figure out what was being said.Unlike Hartranft and most modern translators, Johnston takes exception with calling the sutras ""aphorisms"", pointing out that aphorisms are really standalone gems of wisdom, while sutras are interdependent. I kind of agree with that.  But, being an older translation, the word use is a bit quaint.  For example, Johnson likes the word ""psychic"", but more in the sense of psychological, not extrasensory perception.  He uses the phrase ""judicial action"" to connote ""reflection-free"".  He's fond of the word ""unwisdom"", which Hartranft translates as ""not seeing things as they are"".  And he does over-explain sutras that don't need that much explanation to comprehend.  But then, Hartranft goes into great detail also.The lesson to be learned is that, if you're interested in the original philosophy of Yoga and not just the postures, you should read more than one version of this seminal and relatively short book.  Translations are always tricky, so if you compare and contrast different versions from various time periods and interpreters, you'll achieve a better understanding of the original work.","06 21, 2014",A6J7GN6ZOR085,lonebeaut,Compare and contrast for a better understanding,1403308800

She takes up with a group of Watchers who are actually vampires sworn to protect civilian vampires and humans from rogue vampires.It is an excellent story about despair, newfound hope, personal discovery, and love, filled with a good amount of action. Even though parts of this story were difficult for me to read, I am glad that I did, and am truly looking forward to the next book in the Watchers series.Reviewed at Bitten by Books Paranormal Fiction Review Site by Rachel","12 8, 2008",A10K1JMIPOWD0I,"Rachel P.

Six years later Gregory finally makes Ryland his only to learn that he may lose him. To Gregory Ryland has always been special but he discovers what sets Ryland apart from the other wolves in their pack may be the very same thing that kills him. Ryland is a Tri-Omega and has to have two mates to keep him balanced and safe and he has to be claimed by both mates daily or he will die. So now that Gregory has claimed him, they have a limited amount of time to locate Ryland other mate. Enter Viktor Beta of another pack that Gregory and Ryland meet while on vacation. Viktor isn't so sure about this whole Tri-Omega thing and he's positive he doesn't want to have to share his mate. This book cleverly overlaps in time with the first book Secret Desires showing the same scenes but with a different perspective. I love this series it as some very hot sex scenes I mean three hot guys sexing is oh so hot. This book had a few misunderstanding and the lack of communication due in part to Gregory and Viktor not wanting to share and the fact that they are attracted to each other and them not understanding that they all have to come together as one. I am looking forward to reading the rest of this series.","04 28, 2014",A1QJ17BR5K3C8K,"Angela ""Tell us about yourself!""",Forbidden,1398643200

While I have expanded my selections of reading material, my first love is Sci/Fi and this satisfied my craving.It is a fast paced Sci/Fi novel with both strong male & female Alpha characters with a lot of fights and battles.  Wulf was the ultimate Alpha male wanting to do nothing but protect his mate but having to come to term with the fact that with her experience & abilities, Melina was not going to stay on the sidelines.  While Melina is a kick-ass heroine and capable of taking down the bad guys she's not invincible and does have to deal with injuries.  Too many times in a novel, the stong Alpha female is shown overcoming the bad guys with only a few bruises to show for it.  In both novels that I have read so far by Monette Michaels, the Alpha females while able to deal with the bad guys are not invincible and are therefore more credible.The world building is fantastic and believable for a Sci/Fi novel.  As for Wulf growling - enjoyed it.  I like a growly Ultra Alpha male.The novel is more actions and a slow build up to the love scenes and I really enjoyed that part.  My problem with this novel is that I was very much wishing that this was just a start to a series and that there were other books because I really want to read more about Wulf's brothers finding their mates.  As of yet, I have not found any more in the series but I'm still looking.Update:  I found the author's web page and found that while this book appeared to be a start of a series that no more books have been published or are in the working stage.  This I found rather disappointing because at the end of this book the reader was set up for the next book regarding one of Wulf's brothers finding and dealing with his mate.  It makes me wonder whether the other book EYE OF THE STORM will suffer the same fate - a great start but no follow up.  This does not take away from the fact that I enjoyed both books but I did find it disappointing.","06 23, 2011",AYZ3XI8VSE6C1,Rare Reviewer,Stong Alpha male & female characters,1308787200

It discusses the causes and contributing factors to wonky pH levels. There are lists of foods that are alkaline and acidic. The text generally advocates eating more vegetables, green powders, and drinking freshly juiced fruits and veggies, which is something I can get behind. Next it covers minerals and other supplements you can take to restore balance, and exercises and other ways to deal with stress (which can affect your pH levels). It would have been nice to see more footnotes or sources throughout the text, as I've learned to be critical unless there are reputable sources and research done on the subject matter. I still think the information is really interesting, if only because it's another way to understand the amazingly complex machine known as the human body.The book is pretty short overall, but it explains its purpose clearly and presents the information about how you can begin to correct your body's pH. The writing is clear and direct, and is essay-like. It's well edited.People looking for alternative solutions for common (non-serious) ailments might enjoy the information presented in this book.

I bought this sleeve for my Kindle DX when Amazon featured it as a lightning deal for under twenty bucks.

It provides good padding and grip, as all Belkin laptop sleeves do, and is ideal for carry-on travel or as protection for the Kindle DX while in a backpack or portfolio case.

However, as a deaf woman talking to people around her,  communication becomes draining and leaves her needing solitude to recharge. Her brother Tad may have had to cancel on their ski trip at the last minute, but Robin decides to go by herself, looking forward to peace and quiet. When Robin is interrupted on her trip by the appealing Keil and his brother, she discovers life will never be the same again.Wolf Signs is a short, fast read that will appeal to paranormal romance and erotica lovers alike. Robin is stunned to find out that werewolves real, she never really knew the truth about her family, and that she has found her very own wolf mate in Keil. The attraction is immediate and hot enough to melt the mountain snow. Personally, I am not a big fan of erotica so I admit, I skipped the sex scenes, but the bits I saw are sure to satisfy readers who enjoy erotica.The plot was kept somewhat simplified to fit into the shorter word count, but Vivian Arend still managed to pack in a lot of action to keep the story moving. I loved how Robin was so happy to find out why she never quite felt like she fit anywhere, and adjusts quite easily to her new life.

7929,9992,B0030ZRWW6,"[1, 3]",4,"I thought this had the makings of a fairly good fantasy book.  It's probably closer to 3.5/3.75 stars but I had to round up on this one.  As someone previously mentioned this book can be read as a stand-alone and while it does get a bit rushed in certain parts, I appreciated that it didn't cut off mid-story and look for a second or third book.  (Although there are additional books which continue with other adventures.)A few good things:I enjoyed seeing some new races that I hadn't really read about previously, Algors and Delvers.  It would be good to have a better understanding of the Algors and what gives them almost a hive mentality while still trying to be individuals.  More insight in to what makes the Delvers a separate race when they pretty much mix in and breed with humans.  At this point all we see is that there aren't many (for that reason) and they move very quickly.The characters, most of the time, are pretty believable and there is no one character that suddenly gains godly powers or anything.  They all have abilities but not anything over the top.Over all a pretty smooth read, it started a bit slow but then picked up and had enough action to hold my interest throughout the story.A few bad:The basic story was a bit simple and pretty much followed the standard format of the group of various races/traits coming together on their journey to overcome the evil threatening the world.  So it wasn't at times very much like reading a shorter/modified version of Lord of the Rings.  They were even heading to an old dormant volcano / mountain in the end.At times the characters were a bit on noted.  Ryson, the Delver was always a goodie two shoes and would never hurt anyone, even if it meant putting others in danger.  IE: he catches the bad/evil creatures and lets them go, or just knocks them out.  He doesn't even want to ""kill"" some animated sandstone creatures until he's assured that they're not really alive.  It seemed a bit like he was too altruistic or pure/innocent.  It almost made it a bit hard to identify with him as a character for me.  The elves, especially Lief was at time annoying with his quick jumps to argument and yelling.. and of course Ryson pretty much always ignored it or tried to calm him down even though he was usually the target or Lief's over reactions.  The others had similar problems.Maybe it was intentional but there seemed to be a bit of a religious theme thrown in there towards the end with ""Godson"" everywhere and some ""angels"" in the end of the story.  I didn't really see any purpose in that and for me, it didn't really add much of anything to the story.  Also, seemed that there was a very big separation between good characters being completely good and the bad being basically pure evil no real characters in the gray middle area, which could have made things a bit more interesting.Over All:While not in any way an Epic Fantasy Book, but it was a very good light read.  It kept things clean and simple and is something you could easily let younger teens/kids read without any worries.  It was a good standalone book with subsequent books available that involve the characters/groups in different adventures so you can stop with this one or continue if you enjoy it.  I'd suggest this book to anyone who likes the high fantasy style and just wants a fairly easy read.","07 20, 2011",A1K02U5J7EB24U,"R. McClure ""Saeed""",Pretty Good Fantasy,1311120000

As with all not normal wedding with a hyperactive mother of the bride - everything went bigger and larger than life and it is only with the buffer of Docia best gal pal Janie Dupree is she able to survive the day to day angst of her mother.Janie is sweet, really sweet and most everyone that meets her know immediately that she is a push over. There is a however a strand of steel that runs through Janie, but she never shows it but at the rate at which the wedding plans are going downhill it might just make an appearance. While Janie is working her butt off to make every little thing as perfect as possible for the big day - her support which is suppose to be the bestman - could not have a care in the world.Pete Toleffson is the bestman and his motto is ""if  Cal wants something done Cal will ask and if he is not asked it wasn't worth doing"". Pete is Cal's older brother and not that he is not happy for his brother, but he wants no part of the horse and pony show that was happening - this level of happiness was just something that was un-natural for Pete. Pete is a lawyer in his hometown and surprises of surprises the office is getting on fine without him, then there is Cal, he has not stopped smiling since Pete has been in Konigsburg - it's just not natural, then to top the whole mess off, the cute little pixie of a bridesmaid wants to tell him what is role is in this carnival of chaos.Things were bound to come to a head and Pete and Janie was more or less pushed together to stop the wedding train derailing. While they battle the forces of in-laws, family dramas, personality issues and even issues closer to home they find the budding seeds of attraction and appreciation growing between them.They are not fools and they make the best of what is there for them - because Pete must eventually go home and Janie is under no illusion that she has what it takes to hold a man like Pete in Konigsburg.How man ways can I say I love this book. I was determined to  read this before the end of the year and I was so pleased I did that this weekend. WEDDING BELL BLUES is a convoluted mess of comical what if's, that did eventually happen and it was a fun read.I must mention Meg Benjamin's skill first at keeping at the going ons in Konigsburg together and in a straight line, because the chaos was coming from all angles and  everyone had drama or trauma as the case might be. She still managed to maintain that small town feel to her writing style and along with some creative language. The uptight and upright new cast she introduce in this book was a perfect fit to the laid back and irreverent lot of Konigsburg.WEDDING BELLS BLUES is Pete's and Janie's story - even if it was wrapped up the carnival of Docia's wedding. Janie knew right from the moment Docia agreed to a wedding date that she was not going to do it without Janie and Janie got into the spirit of things and at time she almost feels like a dogsbody.  She kiss ass, she sucked up and she made nice and denies alot of what she wanted to get off her chest just for the sake of seeing things through to the end.Even when the bestman started looking like he had two heads for his incompetence as a bestman, she still was sweetness itself. In all that sweetness however Janie had issues closer to home - a nosey demanding mother, a almost boyfriend who will be anything but and a town that she is just coming to see the beauty of, even if it was not her first love.Meeting Pete sets off an emotional chain reaction that she was not stepping away from and she was willing to roll with the punches wherever they take her, even if it's only for a short while, no matter how she wish it was more.Pete is a heart attack waiting to happen - he gives the appearance of laid bad with not a care in the world - a whole new meaning, but underneath he was a bundle of nerves worried about job, home, family and just life in general. Janie crawled under his skin an inch at a time and he was not opposed to what it was doing to him but he was not in the business of hurt - and he had no intention of staying in Konigsburg and this he knew without a doubt will hurt Janie.The highlight of this book for book was it's natural flow from  VENUE IN BLUE JEANS, it build on the special relationships that were being formed in that first book. With an array of characters and side stories popping up, some so everyday it was comical in it's realness.I loved themI hated themand mostly, I wanted to drop a few of them in a vat of oil.But one thing I did was laugh with this book and I laughed alot.Because of this flow from book to book, I would not recommend reading this book without reading VENUE IN BLUE JEANS first because you would miss out on what made these characters who they are.All the issues that befalls a wedding and more is presented in this book and this was one of the more meatier side story, which will ultimately be the cornerstone and why we will are destined to get two more Toleffson men story. I am so looking forward to those as these Toleffson men are rouges and lovers alike.Bottom LineIf you are looking for a read that just hits the spot - with small town issues aplenty, nosey community with no remorse about being nosey and at anytime you just never know what will come out of their mouth - this is the book for you. Scandal, spite and a good fisticuff are just apart of the everyday order of Konigsburg. With loveable characters and everyone having a opinion on everything - Janie And Pete are a blessed calm in the storm - that is until they start creating their own waves.","11 24, 2009",A3INJZFRZRELZI,E.H.

The pictures were a bit wasted on the six inch screen but they were nice to have on the PC app.  All in all formatting is a 4.5 out of 5, the half star being deducted for the lack of chapter links.Content:  I enjoyed meeting Dr. Thorndyke and Dr. Jervis but I didn't get as attached to them as to, say, Poirot or Miss Marple or Sherlock Holmes.  There was much less of ""them"" present in the works... although the fact that Dr. Thorndyke never quite figured out how inept Dr. Jervis was grated a little... maybe I am too used to watching Poirot and Holmes watch indulgently as Hastings and Watson bumble along to believe anyone could be blind to his inadequacies.  The mysteries themselves were generally pretty decent, and the detective work was quite interesting.  Of the three long tales one of the three was incredibly predictable, and two of the three were moderately predictable.  The short stories were far more enjoyable although they were also mostly predictable.  They were fun and kept me reading more so than the novels did.

It was also a freebie from Amazon and I usually go into the freebies with a little bit of caution because, at least in my experience, they typically aren't as well written as books that cost money.  It was also a novella, which is a hard genre to write because you have so little space to fully develop both the characters and theme.  BUT, even though it seemed to have so much going against it the author really seemed to prove herself as a good author.  I immediately felt a connection to Macy and Sean, the main characters of the book, and felt like the plotline, for the most part, could be something that would really happen.  I definitely didn't constantly spend time thinking &#34;There is no way that this could happen.&#34; which added to the books readability.  I liked the story line.  It was sweet and had a little bit of spice which was just what I was looking for when I chose this book.  I also think the Graison did a great job moving the story along at a good pace and was able to write enough and kept it from lacking holes in the plot.  When I was done with the it, I felt like I had read an entire book even though it was a novella.  That is a tough job, given the allotment space, and like I said earlier the author did an excellent job delivering an entire, fully developed story in less than 200 pages.The only thing that I would complain about the plot would be how the story ended.  I don't want to say anything specifics and avoid spoilers, but it just didn't ring true.  If anything, I would rather see a different ending with another novella to make it a series.  After reading the story as it is, I still wish there was more information on what happened to the character after the ending.All in all, I liked the book and would recommend it to someone looking for a light holiday read.  It was cute and reminded me of a Hallmark Holiday movie.  I don't say this to cut the book down.  I say this because this was what I was looking for and I found it in Blame it on the Mistletoe.  4 stars.","12 14, 2013",A19GP20DYUOKVW,"Regina Niesen ""Gina""",Cute light Holiday read.,1386979200

5352,4419,B002AJ7X2C,"[0, 1]",4,"I personally love it when two authors I respect come together on a collaborative work. Blake Crouch and Jack Kilborn come together in the novel Serial.  The novel is a story of hitchhiking at it most terrifying.  Everyone knows that hitchhiking is dangerous, but this novel follows what happens when one truly depraved person picks up another truly depraved human being.  The novel was written in an odd fashion with Kilborn writing the first part and Crouch writing the second with the two of them finishing it over email with 100 - word exchanges without reading what the other person had opened with.  Trust me it makes sense if you ever read it.The Novel Serial is a lot like if Dexter met Dexter but neither one of them had a moral code.  I really enjoyed the novel I just wished it had been longer.  Maybe I'm a little twisted but I would have preferred to at least be rooting for one serial killer over the other.  The characterization is minimal but if you want to have a few disturbing images seared in your mind before bed time this book will deliver.  Hopefully Crouch and Kilborne will attempt a project like this again soon but aim for a full sized novel.

10548,6711,B002NOGE2E,"[17, 20]",4,"The most important question I have when looking at the mix of reviews for this Kindle freebie is this: Did we all read the same book?? It's good for everyone to have their own opinion, but facts are facts, and classifying this as an all-sex-no-plot book is quite inaccurate. The first sex scene doesn't even occur until the 50% mark (on Kindle) and there are only three sex scenes that are described at all, one of which is mostly glossed over. It bothers me when a book is trashed by reviews that incorrectly represent the published material. Is Forbidden: The Sacrifice perfect? No. In my opinion it's quite good (I'll clarify in a moment), but in no way - and this is not opinion - is it a sex-filled smut book with no plot.At thirty-five, Doctor Wesley Atherton is a successful psychiatrist living and working a comfortable, steady life in London. Katherine is a twenty-four year old American who is staying with a family friend in London during her fashion internship when Wes, rather literally, first bumps into her on the Tube. Practical to the point of having been mortally embarrassed by his bohemian parents, Wes had never believed in love at first sight (or second or third sight, actually). He had, however, always firmly believed in recognizing what he wanted in life and working to get it, so when he gets his first glimpse of Katherine's beautiful green eyes and sees that almost precocious smile, Wes does everything humanly possible to convince her that sharing a life with him is what she needs to do - and even though Katherine is engaged to another, Wes is determined to woo her.One evening, following an outing that Wes certainly considers a date, even if Katherine doesn't, their Tube ride comes to a crashing, deadly end, and Wes and Katherine are thrust into Death's awareness - and he's none too happy to have a victim escape his clutches. With the help of a psychic, a spy, and a butler, Wes and Katherine have to embrace a world far more complex and dangerous than they'd previously believed, and hope that the bonds of love that are so new but so deep between them will be enough to save them all.Forbidden: The Sacrifice is actually a nifty little story with a quirky cast of characters and a plot that moves along nicely, once it starts moving. I was totally enamored with Wes and thought he made an excellent protagonist. It's actually been awhile since I've read a book I'd classify as paranormal romance-ish with a male lead and told in first person POV, so if he hadn't been so appealing, amusing, witty, and self-deprecating, this book really could've gone bad for me fast. Fortunately, he was all those things, as well as determined, intelligent, charming, and very much committed to his Katherine. I liked him very much.Unfortunately, and as is often the case with first person POV, the rest of the characters weren't fleshed out as well as they could have been, though I don't really have any major complaints about the level of development in the secondary characters Jennifer, Will, and Charles. The POV just makes it too hard to develop secondary characters fully. At least the history between Wes and Charles and the professional relationship between Wes and Jennifer helped define and flesh out their characters enough to work in the story (Charles in particular). The only real complaint I had with character development was, unfortunately, Katherine. As the female lead, I would've liked to have seen quite a bit more development and dimension given to her personality and what was there was not always appealing. She was a bit too wishy-washy for me - insecure, afraid, and doubting one minute, determined, strong, and certain the next, with no clear rhyme or reason in the vacillation, and she was never written as a fight-by-his-side sort of female. She was pushed into rooms and hidden behind doors. Protected. I can understand Wes' need to do that, but I'm a bit too much of a feminist to accept Katherine's willingness to allow it. That IS personal opinion and preference, though, and others may not feel the same.I liked the plot and I loved that it was centered in London. I had a few issues with the pacing, though, and a minor complaint about the opening chapters. The story starts with an out of sequence event, the Tube crash, and because of the nature of the crash, the narrative (Wes' perspective) is disjointed and choppy - confused and wounded. While it's completely understandable that it would be that way given what's just happened to him and to Katherine, because we don't know either of them yet, it's a little jarring and takes a bit of perseverance to wade through with any sense of feeling for these characters we've just met. I wish the story had been told in a more linear fashion starting with the meeting of the lead characters, so that when the crash occurred, we had a baseline understanding of Wes in particular and some empathy for his fear about Katherine's plight.Perseverance, however, does pay off in this instance, and once the story pushes beyond the crash the plot really starts to zing along and Wes turns out to be vastly entertaining as he tells his story. The paranormal aspects of the book are slowly added until the intensity and danger reaches a tense fruition. Again, I have another personal opinion/preference. I wish those paranormal aspects had started to sneak in a bit sooner and built a bit faster. I don't think the plot was slow, but I do think that the pacing could've been improved by spending less time with Wes being oblivious and doubtful of the mounting paranormal events around him and more time on the climax to the story, which I personally thought felt a wee bit rushed and a bit confusing for that rush. As a result, I thought the climax was a little less powerful and lacked the impact it could've had, given the gravity of the thing.Circling back around to the sex topic, I feel the need to elucidate my opinion. While the sex scenes weren't overabundant in this book, I will admit, the sex is described graphically. Wes uses adult language and isn't real into flowery euphemisms. In fact, he uses colorful, sometimes coarse language all through the book, and while most is British slang, if you're up on the slang from across the pond, you'll know just how colorful and coarse it is. In my opinion, however - and this is very important to me - the sex scenes develop as a natural, healthy progression of the emotional situation the characters are in at the time, as opposed to gratuitous sex for no other reason than to titillate readers. Hey, I'm all for a bit of fun titillation, but I like to leave the gratuitous kind for when I'm in the mood for erotica romance. This isn't that. I found the sex to be neither overly explicit nor overdone. Take that as you will, as I admit I prefer the sex scenes in my books to be as adult and freely passionate as I prefer sex to be.For a free read, this book is far more than I expected. Considering some of the other ratings and reviews, it's WAY better than I'd hoped. As the start of a paranormal romance series, it definitely has potential and has insured that I will be actually paying for the second book in the series. This was the first book I'd read by Samantha Sommersby. It won't be the last.","05 13, 2010",A2E9HDZXQORZLA,"Tracy ""One Good Book Deserves Another""",There's NO Sacrifice Needed to Enjoy This!,1273708800

2062,6900,B002OHD27U,"[2, 2]",4,"I'll start with reviewing my favorite story of the three novellas, The Sweetest Sin. I absolutely adore the two protagonists Landon and Julianna who were eloped five years ago. It should have been a happy ending but their marriage was annulled when Julianna's father, Lord Trevington, caught up to them and forced her to marry the Duke of Breckinhill. The story however, starts when five years later, Julianna, now a widow goes to Landon for help to save her sister Evelyn who their father has used to pay off his gambling debts. Naturally, Landon asks that she become his mistress in exchange for helping her find her sister. The book flowed rather nicely and despite it being a novella, I feel that it had a lot of depth and the characters, well drawn out. By the end of the book, I ended up rooting for both Landon and Julianna to get their happy ending. This story also introduces us to Evelyn who we will read about in the third book Sin's Mistress. I gave this novella &#10084;&#10084;&#10084;&#10084;&#10084;.In A Wager of Sin, Bianca, now a widow makes a bet with Hawk (Landon's brother). If she wins, all her debts will be paid and if he wins, she becomes his mistress. Pretty simple, right? Apparently, Bianca was married to Hawk's best friend and Hawk felt responsible for his demise when he had an accident because they were drunk the night before. I also liked this story but not as much as I loved The Sweetest Sin. The story was fast paced and also very steamy, perhaps more steamy than the second book. I enjoyed reading about Hawk and Bianca and loved Bianca's transformation into a headstrong widow into an independent woman. I give this novella &#10084;&#10084;&#10084;&#10084;.The last book of the series, Sin's Mistress is about Evelyn, Juliana's sister, who we read out about in The Sweetest Sin. She was sold in exchange to settle her father, Lord Trevington's gambling debts to Raphael Sinclair, known as Sin. Apparently he has been lusting after Evelyn for quite some time and had planned Trevington's downfall so that he can have her in exchange. He takes her to his estate in Devon and introduces her into his life. I actually thought this novella was okay. And yes I admit, it is not my favorite. Despite the characters being well drawn out, I did not warm up to Sin asI hoped and I did not like Evelyn's transformation as much. I give this novella &#10084;&#10084;&#10084;.I bought the Sin Anthology when it was on sale for $1.99 at Barnes and Noble a couple of years ago and I have been re-reading this anthology multiple times. Personally, I love revisiting my favorite characters and books multiple times and this Anthology was a bargain. I give the whole anthology &#10084;&#10084;&#10084;&#10084; just because I thought the last novella was okay. Overall, each of the characters were well drawn out and despite it being a novella, I got the feeling that it was a full novel.

I just haven't found the right book, series, or author to drag me (willingly of course ;) into the M/M world. But I think Evangeline just did that for me.Plot wise, Str8te Boys isn't much of a read, but Maverick and Duke were so entertaining I honestly could care less what they did outside that apartment. I'm double daring these hotties to keep rubbing their big, muscular bodies and c***s to one another while making out with lust-filled hunger until they come on each other!Unholy hell... where are my ice buckets?!!!I thought the whole concept for ""gay chicken"" was ridiculous, especially considering that no straight man in his right mind would let another man touch his junk. But here's where thngs get interesting, because Duke and Mav have taken their ""game"" to extreme possibilities. I love that these guys are jocks. They've been playing in the same soccer team for the past four years (plus in my book, I love soccer players ;)), and they've been roomies and bff's since their freshmen year of college. Str8te Boys is told from Maverick's POV, and it's interesting because as ""uncomfortable"" as he gets when Dukes talks guy on guy action, he still allows him to get close. To play with his c*** to kiss, to lick... and so many other sinfully delicious things.Duke is suppose to be straight as well, according to Mav, but it didn't take long for me to begin to question these guys' sexual orientation, and then things really take off when Duke and Mav go to a photo shoot together. Basically a porn site for gay men with straight looking ones.The more Duke and Mav's relationship progresses, the more Mav begins to question his nature. Everything seems perfect for the two until a late night trip to the drugstore ends with Duke's heart being broken. Now, Mav must come to terms with who he truly is, or risk losing not only his best friend, but his heart as well.Like I said, the idea of ""Gay Chicken"" for me was ridiculous, but so very clever at the same time. Both Mav and Duke were great characters. I would have loved seeing some soccer action, and them interacting outside of each other.

748,7546,B002RKSZJO,"[63, 67]",4,"This is Jules Verne's classic tale of undersea adventure, as best I can tell based on the 1873 translation by Lewis Mercier. Since that's been the standard English translation for over a hundred years, it's probably the one you remember reading way back when, and the edition you'll be familiar with.Re-reading this as an adult, and an adult who's spent twenty-plus years since then reading science fiction, I did have to remind myself more than once how amazing the then-future technologies Verne describes, like electric rifles, undersea diving suits, electric motors, etc., would have been to his contemporary readers; the book was first published in 1869, a mere five years after the Confederate submarine Hunley became the first submarine to sink an enemy warship (and sank itself in the process).  At times I found myself mentally substituting ""outer space"" for ""under sea,"" just to help me analogize the situation. Despite that,  the plot and action were as riveting now as they were when I first read it twenty years ago. I did find myself, now as then, skimming over much of Verne's extensive scientific descriptions of undersea flora and fauna, etc., but that might be my own failing as a reader -- when I did take the time to read Verne's descriptions, I did sometimes catch the same sense of aquatic wonder I remember from watching films like _The Life Aquatic_.From what I've read, the Mercier translation this is based on contains a number of translation errors, cuts out about 20% of the text, etc. Corrected, completed, updated ebook editions of this classic are available on Amazon, but they cost money -- I've been unable to find an out-of-copyright, corrected, complete, and free edition. For readers on a budget, though, this is probably the version you remember, and if read in the right way -- keeping in mind the era in which it was written, and skimming whenever the science gets too dry or detailed for you -- it's still quite entertaining.Verne did write a sequel, _The Mysterious Island_, also available in the kindle free store; the better translation is available here:The Mysterious Island.","06 8, 2010",A1KPDKD7VYRE3B,T.

He works from his Minnesota home. He is withdrawn and rather taciturn. Actually, he lives like a hermit because of his horrible childhood. His safe routine is blown to pieces when the daily sight of an unknown woman walking her dog sends his feelings in a turmoil.Jenny Fitzgerald's sex life is non-existent. The only guy who wants to date her is a creepy man named Evan. Evan is her co-worker and a mean guy. And then some day the love god sends her...this yummylicious specimen of a hot, sweet, AND shy man! This Nordic god standing in the middle of the path in a snowstorm is William. For a few days they go out for a walk with Jen's dog Rosie. Eventually, she 'invites' him on a date...Will's obvious fascination with her, his single-minded focus on her, makes her feel beautiful and interesting. His fixation on her is a bit disconcerting but hard to resist nevertheless!I really liked this book. The main couple is very sympathetic and there are good secondary characters as well. I truly LOVED Chris, the gay guy. He was so funny! The dialogs were good and hilarious - especially between Chris and Jenny. The hero was so taciturn, there wasn't really much room to develop exceptional dialogs. Of course I have to say that Will's dialogs fit him perfectly. He wasn't much of a talker and he was insecure and shy, therefore his answers were always short. His demeanor was very endearing - such a sweet guy! And he didn't even realize how hot he was! The sex scenes...gosh, they were really steamy and both of them were heating up the shower AND the sheets. I was so surprised to see how experienced the hero was when it came down to sex. I mean he was a virgin. Obviously, he learned a lot while watching certain movies. *cough*The beginning of this story was superb and I was totally hooked. And it reminded me a bit of Barbara Elsborg's books. Later on the pace slowed down and the plot didn't move forward as I'd have expected. But suddenly I had to read about this near-rape scene and the plot moved at a faster pace. Again.If you read the blurb then you know that this book contains a realistic, violent near-rape scene. Be prepared for an utterly nail-biting, heart-stopping, and thrilling scene of agony. When I read this particular scene, I truly felt for Jen, I hurt for her and I told myself over and over again ""When will it be over and when will the hero come to her rescue??"" Actually, when Will came and rescued Jen, I felt a tremendous relief!What didn't work for me:The author could have exploited the potential of this story much more. We know that Will had a rather horrible childhood. This topic could have been explored way better and I wanted more background story about Will. I wanted more insight, I wanted to know what goes on in his head. Sure, the author gave us a few glimpses but I just felt that it required further 'explanations'. Furthermore, I wanted him to open up completely, and I was waiting for his meltdown in front of Jen. The main couple never discussed his being a `virgin'. Will didn't tell Jen about his virginity. He was such a sensitive guy and I wanted to read about such a particular and important scene. I wanted him to ""Break the Silence"". The author didn't let that happen. Unfortunately. That's my biggest regret. Additionally, the whole marriage proposal felt a bit too rushed - it didn't ring true to me.Loved those 'lines':[...]""Sorry, Will - force of habit. And you're way too pretty to resist.""""Try."" Jenny took Will's arm and tugged him out of Christian's reach. ""I still haven't forgiven you for stealing my last potential date away from me.""Christian looked blank. ""Who?""""Trevor? Bike messenger guy? Ringing any bells?""""Oh please,"" Christian scoffed. ""If you don't want me to steal them, then don't go out with closet cases.""Will's muscles tightened at this, his shoulder blades pulling together.""Don't worry."" Christian must have noticed the small movement. ""I can tell you're as straight as an arrow. The flirting before was just...staring through the candy shop window without a penny in my pocket, that's all."" [...][...]Sometimes, she thought wryly, talking to Will was like playing twenty questions.[...]Overall, Breaking the Silence is an entertaining and engrossing read.

There are a lot of characters crammed into a small space, and there's way too much assumed knowledge on the part of the author.  That's the bad bit.So why four stars?  Because I found the interaction between the three main characters: Logan (Loki), Kir (Baldur), and Jordan to be just wonderful.  Bell is great at creating distinct characters that shine through their actions. Paranormal romance is often bogged down with melodramatic dialogue.  Bell's conversations are delightful--they are the kind of laughing interactions I have with my own friends (er, minus the sex).  Additionally, there was a great sweetness to the romance that was a treat to read.So here's my tip: if you want to really enjoy this book, read a quick primer on Norse mythology first.

This grim twist on Grimm is original, unique, and interesting, and Walker has penned another dark, rich novella to start an exciting new series. So much urban fantasy and paranormal romance is based around the idea that there's always a kernel of truth in all folk lore and fairy tales, and Walker not only embraces that ideology, she slams into it, tackles it to the ground, and hog ties it until it does her bidding!In Candy Houses, Greta and Rip are known to children everywhere as Gretel of Hansel and Gretel fame, and Rip as in Van Winkle, but neither one of the fairy tales and folk lore that surround them do more than glimmer at the truth. Greta, as she prefers to be called now, and Rip, didn't get anything resembling a happily ever after like the stories say. They got an immortal upgrade and were given wings, becoming a member of the Grimm, a group of guardian angels that are here to help humanity and save them from the myriad of dangers from other realms, demons, and other assorted nasties. Their wings are more metaphorical than actual, of course, but their skill is unmatched, and they're very hard to kill. They have to be. It's a dark, often lonely, deadly life that takes its toll on its warriors.Greta and Rip worked together about a hundred years ago and after a night of passion that rocked both their worlds, Greta fled, and hasn't been able to stop thinking of Rip ever since. And Rip knows that he may not survive another encounter with Greta, the woman he loved and lost after far too brief a time all those years ago. Could the fact that they've ended up in the same city at the same time, fighting what turns out to be the same fight be a good omen for them both? Perhaps Happily Ever After isn't out of the question after all?Candy Houses manages to develop both Greta's and Rip's characters with a surprising level of depth and complexity as well as provide a truly taut and tense plot that moves quickly even as it offers a lot of world building and mythos creation to start this series. I'm impressed again at Walker's ability to use what length allowed in her novellas to provide such a full reading experience, and I think the twist on the fairy tale idea is brilliant.The only caveat (IMO) was the final conflict at the end. With all the development and mythos explanation, Candy Houses is still limited to a novella length story, and there seems to have been a sacrifice made. There were motivations and explanations that didn't get explained, and the conflict with Big Bad ended up being a lot of hype with little hazard. It was a little of a letdown. Still, points for everything Walker manages to accomplish in this nifty little novella and I've already downloadedNo Prince Charming: Grimm's Circle, Book 2so I can continue with these dark and delicious fairy tales.","05 31, 2010",A2E9HDZXQORZLA,"Tracy ""One Good Book Deserves Another""",A Gem More Grim than Grimm,1275264000

That's when she mostly encounters the frustrating Master vampire, Marc LaTour, who has moved in while having his own home renovated.  Marc is sexy and appeals to Kelly like no other, but she must keep her distance, because she doesn't want to end up just another meal.  Marc loves Kelly's quick wit and attitude.  She draws him like a moth to a flame.  When a threat to Kelly is revealed, he must protect her and keep her safe.  Kelly and Marc struggle to learn what they mean to each other, but in the end Fate always has her way.Rare Vintage is Book 2 in Bianca D'Arc's Brotherhood of the Blood series.

But nope, not our hero. He just doesn't comprehend why everyone doesn't just accept how absolutely right he is about everything. For someone chosen to be a member of an elite shifter version of Special Forces, this lack of judgment seems like a major liability.I did enjoy rolling my eyes at this guy's stupidity, as well as the appearances of the characters from previous books. On the down side, his ""little friend"" in this book (who pretty much derails his relationship,) also figures into the new series, Halle Shifters. I cringe to think that she will be an important character there, as she is selfish, immature and not at all likable. Unfortunately, she was given a ""special connection"" to a really great secondary character. What's with her and these ""special connections"" to the male characters?

Gregor is the second eldest of the Faustin brothers; from the Russian vampyr family line. He runs a series of successful clubs, made famous for the fact that they cater to New York's vampire population - a publicity cachet the clubbers love, and the vampyrs appreciate. Gregor has his pick of women, and is at the top of his game, so the last thing he needs is for fate to interrupt his life. But when you're a Faustin vampyr, you have to listen when destiny speaks . . . or suffer the consequences.Gregor is told the name of his intended bride - Madelena. But Gregor ignores the heads-up and continues on his partying ways . . . unsuspecting, until fate intervenes with a crash.`Bound by Blood' is the second book in Evie Byrne's `Faustin Brothers' trilogy. Though it is the second book, the plot timing seems a little out-of-sync with first book `Called by Blood'. In this book, Alex is a rampant bachelor and is yet to meet his wife, Helena. So really, it would make more sense that `Bound' be the first book in this trilogy, instead of the second ...I am really liking Evie Byrne's `Faustin' trilogy. I love the fact that Byrne is writing a modern vampire tale - her characters are clued-up about vampiric myths and fanged pop-culture icons, but there's also an old-world vibe. Each brother finds his bride through premonition - fated by their mother who has dreams of her future daughters-in-law. In `Called' Alex was ecstatic to finally find his bride, partly because his older brother had recently settled so well into holy matrimony. But as we back-track, it's revealed that Gregor in fact found fate to be rather inconvenient. I love that Byrne marries some old-world mysticism with modern inconvenience - a New York vampire club owner who is put-out by his destined bride. Hilarity ensues when fate intervenes, brutally.In `Called by Blood', Byrne took a very different romantic route - by severely burning her Alpha hero, and leaving him looking like raw hamburger meat. Byrne does it again in `Bound', this time posing a difficult dilemma before the heroine. I won't give it away, but I really liked the hurdle before Gregor and Madelena, if only because it completely turned the tables on the traditional vampire/mortal romance.I like Evie Byrne's paranormal romance. Once again, I wish the book had been longer, mostly because I think the really interesting part of the story would have come in the aftermath of the romance.

I don't think I missed anything important to the plot of this book by skipping the second book, though I'm not sure if book three could be a stand alone, without book one setting up the monsters and everything.Runako, the male lead in this book was the villain in the first book.  He is angry at humans because they tortured and killed his twin sister, and so he doesn't want the Monster movie to be made.  However, after losing a battle with Luke, Runako is forced to change into human form.  There is instant attraction between Runako and Margo, the producer for the Monster movie.  This book starts with Runako abducting Margo off of the street, and taking her to a ""Captives Cave"" in the Rockies.  At the start, Margo is very much Runako's prisoner, and he chains her to a rock alter in the cave.  Runako has a great sense of smell in his monster form, so he can tell that Margo is attracted to him, and enjoys what he does to her, even if her words tell a different story.  Runako definitely has issues, he is still very upset about the death of his twin sister, and human nature.  Margo has some body and control issues.  Runako and Margo work to help each other overcome these issues.This book has more action than the first book in the series.  I enjoy reading thrillers, so I loved the action scenes.  The reader may have to let go a bit of reality to find the action scenes believable, but you're already reading a book about monster/human love, so it shouldn't be hard to just let a little more go.  This book also introduces additional monsters, as well as showing more about monster life, since location is primarily by Runako's home in the Rockies.  Like the other books in the series, this also includes a lot of monster/human sex.Overall, I'm happy with the decision to purchase the third book in the series.","08 1, 2011",A1WEGF26C76IBT,STL Chick,Runako's story,1312156800

The characters have very specialized functions on the team (Leader, Sargent, Scout, Sniper, and Medic) and the author does a good job building the sense that they are a cohesive unit. During the course of their mission, things take an unexpected turn and they find themselves in a totally different situation than the one they were sent to deal with.

Another short story that comes to the mind that had similar character development isThe Mist Of Remembering: Erotic Romance Fantasyby Sandra Ross.

This story is rather short so I don't want to tell you more otherwise you wouldn't get the most out of it. All I can say is the ending will definitely surprised because of the brilliant plot twist that the author, Stephanie Draven has implemented.You won't be disappointed if you love stories with a mixture of romance and suspense.

It reviews the fear and distrust many late 19th century thinkers had for societies such as the Freemasons, Marxists, and Anarchists, as well as their contempt for non-Christian religions.  When reading this book, however, it is important to keep in mind that these are the thoughts of two individuals who even in their day, were seen as fringe writers dealing in fear and paranoia.  Beecher, for example, was the abolitionist brother of Harriet Beecher Stowe, who wroteUncle Tom's Cabinwhile Jonathan Blanchard was an abolitionist preacher well known for his inflamatory anti-masonic rhetoric.  One of their primary purposes in publishing this work was to reinforce the superiority of American-style Protestant Christianity over Hinduism and Islam, both of which had achieved a great deal of popularity among the New England academic and economic elites.  Freemasonry, another major topic in the book, had recently been involved in an event known as the ""Paris Commune"", where a group of Marxists and Anarchists temporarily gained political control over Paris.  Both Blanchard and Beecher were concerned that this movement would endanger stability in the United States where memories of both the Civil War and Reconstruction were livid, angry scars on the psyche of the nation.Secret Societies, therefore, provides keen insight into the logic and rational behind the deep concern felt by a generation of Americans that had seen their country torn by civil war and feared the rising popularity of Marx-inspired secret societies could lead directly to a renewal of widespread violence.","07 18, 2010",A50EGYZY7RHGI,"Brian K.

It takes a little convincing, but she begins to believe when the man she wished for suddenly comes back into her life. The only problem is she is limited to forty-eight hours before the wish expires and there are some catches the fairy initially fails to mention that could ruin everything. Now that Mariah is finding love, she has to get her happily ever after and will do whatever it takes to make all her dreams come true.I admit I didn't expect much from this short novel. It sounded like something I probably wouldn't even be able to finish. Yet once I started reading, the story really grabbed my attention. Mariah is a strong and independent woman, but she isn't afraid to dream and take chances. She has a sweet and soft side that helps you relate to her. When Tucker shows up, you root for her to find the love she wants with him. I will warn he isn't quite as easy to relate to in the beginning. This could be due to the fact I am not much of a poker fan and this guy made a living as a professional poker player. Definitely not my kind of dream guy. Yet I hung in there for Mariah's sake and eventually found myself really liking Tucker as more of his background came out. Despite it being a short novel, you get enough details to help you understand the two main characters and feel like you know them fairly well by the end. Even some of the side characters were great and helped flesh the story out.There are a couple other things that could be considered both strengths and weaknesses for the novel. One, there are a lot of sex scenes and they begin early on in the story. I had hoped to get a little more warmed up to the characters first and that threw me off a bit. On the other hand, you learn a lot by what they are thinking and saying during those scenes. Tucker and Mariah met many years before so there is a lot of reminiscing even as they jump back in the sack together. Also, the author does an excellent job of writing sizzling scenes that most any romance reader could appreciate. I wish the story had been longer and more drawn out (there was a lot of room for growth) but I also understand writers like to tell the story as they see it. You don't have to deal with all the misunderstandings that are often used as ploys to prevent the H/h from finding their Happily Ever After (HEA) more quickly. It was refreshing to see the two characters forthright and upfront about their feelings without all the holding back you often see.There were a couple of instances where the dialog seemed a bit weird to me, but most of the time I had no problem with it. The ending was the best part. It tied everything up and even provided for some comedy (I won't say how, you'll just have to read it). All in all, this was a novel I don't regret trying and believe it is one most romance readers will enjoy. It looks like this is the first in a series so I plan to check out the ones that follow ""All In"". I have faith they will be at least as good as this one.","03 14, 2012",A3S3DNSUREE2NK,"Mistress of The Dark Path ""Suzie""",A compelling contemporary romance with a spark of the paranormal,1331683200

I can see that.&#8221; But it&#8217;d been years since my early OMG-I-LOVE-Ilona binge, so I decided a reread was in order.And here we are.Some time in the indeterminate future, when space colonization was the new Big Thing, humans began to genetically enhance themselves. They needed to be stronger, faster, heartier, more versatile. Some of these enhancements were tech-based, effecting only the individual, and some were biological, being inherited by offspring.&#34;It was quickly realized that the advantage of these biological enhancements lay in their exclusivity. Thus, the biologically enhanced united and shut down all further biological modification.&#34;And consolidated their power. They were called the Kinsmen, and to maintain both the potency and exclusivity of their enhanced blood, the families arranged marriages for their children based on bloodlines and business alliances.This is why Meli Galdes was betrothed to Celino Carvanna when she was 10 years old and he was 16.While neither of them was happy with the arrangement, Meli accepted it, but Celino did NOT. He worked the next 6 years to make himself indispensable to his family, and worth more as an individual than the alliance with the Galdes family.And he succeeded.But where did that leave Meli?An excellent question. And one you will only get the answer to by . . . wait for it . . . yes, that&#8217;s right&#8212;READING the book. *winsome face*Verdict: a quick, fun, and SEXY read.

It is here that she enters a mysterious room, one normally off limits, but tonight her boss, Rattler, tells her to go rest there after her shift.Mal stretches out and soon falls asleep; she awakens to find herself in a new place, a much different place where these gray-skinned aliens reside. And these are not the little gray men aliens. No, these men are tall, muscular and almost reptilian in looks, with fangs and black-slitted eyes. The hero, Core, is the War Leader, a type of king in this world, and he has a huge snake tattooed on his chest. Not only is Core able to transform into something that appears both human and snake-like at the same time, his tat can even embody a powerful snake spirit that moves off his chest and becomes alive.I was fascinated by this idea of a snake-shifter. To be honest, snakes don't normally go hand-in-hand with sexy for me, but Core managed to pull it off. He kind of reminded me of a tough biker mixed with deadly warlord. Not only was he badazz and sexy, he was also sweet and protective of Mal. It turned out that he and Mal were each exactly what the other needed, in several ways, leading to a very sexy and magical relationship.This story is only 79 pages, but it gets a lot of story into those pages. Sure, sometimes it can seem a little rushed, but overall, the story is pretty creative and very interesting. Actually, it ended with me very much wanting to know more about this alien world, about a few of Core's fighters/friends, and most of all, wanting to find out more about this rival race called the Phrellians. There is definitely a lot more here for the author to revisit, and even room for her to go deeper. Rattler definitely needs a story.For a dollar, this was really a nice surprise. It had some action, interesting characters, and this other world, making for an intriguing mix of PNR with alien romance. And I have to say I've never read a book with a snake-shifter before, just very different to have this oddly sexy snake-man as a hero.

She's been watching Jericho and Hunter, two men who live in an isolated cabin, and they have been watching her. When she is hurt, she allows them to help her--and they discover that their wild cougar companion is in fact a beautiful woman. They both form an attachment to her, and are reluctant to leave her even when their work calls them away.I liked that the plot was slow and mellow. It has a quiet, isolated feel that I found relaxing. It isn't an adventure story, and the paranormal element is uncomplicated and matter-of-fact. That simplicity really fit the story and set the tone.While reading this story, I spent a great deal of time trying to figure out how the author intended to characterize each of her protagonists. Kaya comes across as a bit weak and helpless, but then you have to bare in mind that she hasn't had much human contact. Still, I feel like the author could have spent a little time establishing that Kaya does have some innate strength, and isn't totally dependent on her men to provide for her. Hunter is portrayed as the more closed off, emotionally isolated of the two men. Why that is is never fully explained. I can't really get a handle on Jericho's personality at all, other than that he's a bit more open than Hunter. Both men are, of course, insanely protective and intent on caring for Kaya. I think part of the problem at work here is page limitation. It's a short book, so there is only a limited amount of time to establish everyone's personality and allow them to develop.My other ""complaint"" is the sunny, slightly sugar coated ending. Everyone is accepting of Kaya and her relationship with two men. Nobody comments or thinks it's odd. Everybody is just part of a big happy family. That's a bit unrealistic. But then, this book has shape-shifting so I guess I shouldn't demand realism.All told, for a novella you can read in one day, this is worthwhile. It has steam, emotion, and a fairly satisfying happy ending. 3.5 stars.","08 29, 2011",A2CCQ83OH7WGAE,Chelsea Marie Spencer,A Cougar and Two Mates,1314576000

L'Amour was a staple when I was growing up, and I still return to him again and again as I go along.  Fair Blows the Wind remains my favorite novel by the author because it's such a combination of Old World swordplay, coming of age, and early Americana.  But that's beside the point.In James Brionne, L'Amour creates one of his best fighting men, a man who'd served in the Union Army during the Civil War, a man who had the ear of President Grant - and a man who had lost his wife to tragic circumstances.  The first few pages of the book draw the reader in and sets him on a journey to see good triumph over evil.The book is much as I remember it, written with a lot of introspection and bouncing around from character to character, with less action and tension than I would have liked.  L'Amour also instills a romantic lyricism in his word choice, though.  James Brionne is an educated man, a thinker, and that shows on the pages.There's no real tension about where the reader is going to get during the read because the endgame is almost transparent.  Still, L'Amour manages to throw a couple curves in there that will leave you unsettled about a few things as you turn the pages.I wish there had been a little more to the story, and even the ending just seems to coast to a halt rather than escalating.  The pieces just fall together without any real stress or narrative tension.The plot is pretty thin even for a L'Amour novel, but the tale pulled me through again, and even though I knew how the book ended, and would have known anyway because it's so clear, I enjoyed roving through the Old West and stepping through my own past.","06 11, 2013",A1U360OMVQRPUB,Mel Odom,Brionne,1370908800

Then he meets the magician, Satori, and things get even stranger.  With a history of spells of black despair, Edwin can't be sure if his attraction to the strange magician is real or not...Sleight of Hand is an odd and hot paranormal tale in which things are not as they seem.  Katrina Strauss did an excellent job of evoking an atmosphere that was mysterious, and even a little spooky.  I couldn't always determine what was reality and what wasn't right away, which kept me reading to find out.  It was easy to sympathize with fragile, earnest Edwin.  Satori was a bit harder to get a handle on.  His motives were murky and although he clearly wanted Edwin, I wasn't sure I bought that he loved him.  There's a big twist at the end that sort of explains Satori's behavior, and quite a few other things.  Overall, Sleight of Hand's hot, kind of creepy vibe held my interest, and I enjoyed the story.

9288,6105,B002I1XQ0A,"[6, 6]",4,"Alexia Colton had spent every summer since she was fourteen visiting her grandmother in the charming seaside town of Jaffrey's Cove, until adulthood and the need to work kept her away. She loves the ocean, and always felt a sense of peace and home there, and was always enchanted by the dolphins that often play in the surf just off the shore. When her grandmother, a once strong and vibrant woman, now feeble and needing help to move into an assisted living facility, calls Alexia sounding frantic, Alexia rushes to her gram's side to get her settled. Sharing this time with her grandmother, whom Alexia can tell is starting to decline in health and mental acuity, is invaluable to her, and when Victoria offers her granddaughter her seaside home and a stunning family heirloom, Alexia takes the necklace but declines on the house. Her work is in the middle of the country, after all.Soon Alexia is having erotic dreams of the boy, now a man, she'd once met as a child, making love to her in a cavern she's dreamed of her entire life. And her gram is acting stranger and stranger...and significantly less feeble than she'd been when Alexia first arrived. The ocean is calling to her and her body is burning with unfamiliar hungers. Alexia's world is shifting and she'll soon realize that she's not as human as she'd always thought, mermen are real, and the dolphins she's loved her whole life are all citizens of Jaffrey's Cove. And Alexia herself is the new matriarch of their pod, with two gorgeous and dedicated consorts, the cousins Joshua and Anthony, to love her body, heart, and mind for as long as she chooses. What's not to love about life changes like that??I don't need to spend much time on the erotica aspects of Tidal Wave. The sex is sizzling hot and extremely well done. Arend manages a nice blend of emotion driven sexuality and explicit sex that's extremely satisfying and too rare in erotica romance. I also have to give her credit for how deftly she managed to keep the sex scenes (of which there are several...it's erotica, after all) from completely overshadowing or eclipsing the plot and character development. That's rather a nifty accomplishment in a novella length story, which tends to suffer in those areas to begin with. Also, I'm very very picky about my reading choices when it comes to menage a trois erotica, when I read it at all. It's not a particular favorite of mine and I rarely find menage done in a way that appeals to my tastes. Tidal Wave mastered that for me. I was exceptionally pleased with all sexual aspects of the story.The other parts had a few bumps of a less erotic kind. This isn't the first story or series I've read by Vivian Arend. I've read several of the Granite Lake Wolves, as well, so this wasn't too much of a surprise because I've had this issue with her as an author before. Arend tends to master the sex and the emotion of a story in very short order, but the plot and characterizations sometimes have issues, as Tidal Wave does. Some of that is the nature of the beast in a novella. I like the way Arend writes and I'm greedy, so I want there to be more meat to the story, but to have more meat you have to either sacrifice some of the sex or write a book. While I have high hopes that Arend will eventually write a full length novel, with her novellas, she has a tendency to skimp a bit on fully developing the mythos of the world she's built in each story. In Tidal Wave that was a particular shame, because I would've loved learning more about the merpeople and spent more time with them in their dolphin form. I found the concept behind the plot to be fresh and unique and that's so rare it should be fully explored.There were a couple of plot holes and characterization blips that got ignored in this story. Why was Joshua sent away every summer Alexia returned to Jaffrey's Cove after the first time they met and shared a sweet kiss when she was fourteen? He wondered but there was never an answer given. Why was he treated so dismissively by his brothers? Why did Alexia dream of the cavern before ever going there and before receiving the medallion? No one ever had before. Those holes were frustrating.There was no explanation for Joshua's sudden calm acceptance of his cousin vying for Alexia's affections when earlier in the story he was quite adamant about being her only. The quick turn around in Anthony's case, from him telling Joshua he wasn't really interested in answering Alexia's call to being all gung ho about consorting with her was addressed, but in a cursory way at best that felt unsatisfying. Michael's plot thread was a very nice conflict and it added some depth to the story, but it wasn't as fleshed out as I would've liked, lacked a real solid motivation given the defined mythos of the pod, and the resolution was lackluster. Victoria was a nice secondary character, but she wasn't used as much as she could've been and she sort of left her granddaughter with very little understanding of her people. You'd think the former matriarch would care a little more than just passing off a necklace before disappearing.I know it sounds like I'm being picky, but it's frustrating to find that great blend of erotic sexuality and original mythos with an intriguing plot and totally likable characters...then have a bunch of little issues through the story. None of that made me dislike Tidal Wave by any means. I hope I don't give that impression. I enjoyed the story...it's just I wish there had been a bit more.

It looked like a good book, so I downloaded it and gave it a quick read, and am very glad I did!`Seducing a Stranger' is a historical erotic story that really puts you in the world inhabited by the characters.  Victoria Paget is a widow seeking proof that her husband, a Captain, was murdered.  She resorts to going to a bawdy house to seduce the Lieutenant that she suspects is responsible for her dear husband's death.  She feels that she has to do this so she won't let him down in death the way she feels she did during his life.  She is a strong, vivid character that is easy to relate to and impossible not to like.Tom Godfrey is the sexy young Lieutenant that is believed by Victoria to be behind her husband's death.  He turns out to be gentlemanly and is extremely surprised to find the widow of his previous Captain in the bawdy house, and he falls instantly in love with her.  Of course, this being an erotic story, I should probably say he fell in lust with her, lol!  The two quickly become involved in a hot, steamy relationship that is put to the test when Victoria finally discloses her beliefs about Tom.I liked the historical aspect of the story, and the author did a good job keeping the language and description appropriate for a historical story.  Although it is hard to develop characters that are believable and likeable in a short story, the author did a commendable job.  I especially like Victoria and the fact that she was willing to go to such extreme measures to get her dead husband the respect she felt he deserved.  I am not sure I could put myself in such a dire situation as selling my body just for answers, and the time period in which the story takes place would have made that an extremely risky endeavor for a widow to undertake.Tom was also a great character; although a true gentleman wouldn't be in a bawdy house in the first place, so that put me off him a little bit.  However, the sexy bits were sizzling and fit the story perfectly.  The descriptions used were exciting and appropriate, and they made the story really stand out.  I would say that if I found other works by this author I would probably read them since I enjoyed this one so much.

When the high school's resident mean girl turns up dead no one is quite sure where to look. The high school sweetheart? The lovestruck friend? Or is it someone completely unexpected? In any case expect a good dollop of witchcraft and slight hints at romance.Overall I really liked the series. There's one or two things that could be changed, most noticably the romantic triangle. It's painfully obvious that Marcus is interested in Maggie (and not dating Liss). It's even more obvious that Tom is not right for Maggie- their romantic scenes just come across as awkward and the reader can't help but wonder when Maggie will realize that she's dating the male equivalent of her mother & sister. For that matter I can't help but wonder if this is all going to pay off in a future book when Maggie FINALLY realizes that she can be her own person without running away or alienating her family. (I.E., her breaking it off with Tom is the defining moment when she realizes that she doesn't have to put up with people telling her how she should live her life or being condescending.) That's pretty much the only big thing that is flawed so far in the series. I know that Alt's probably saving it for some big scene later on in the series, but I can't help but get a little frustrated and impatient. It's just a bit tedious. In any case Alt needs to trim the dead weight (Tom) out of the series & either make him less condescending (making him a more believable romantic possibility) or downgrade him to an occasional character.4.8/5","12 19, 2008",A2XNOB1T796Y6B,"ChibiNeko ""Sooo many books, so little time!""",Steadily getting better!,1229644800

Meet Argus Ward, a former Secret Service agent who runs a protection agency catering to the rich and famous.  His secret: he is a functioning paranoid schizophrenic.  Accused of killing a famous client, who is also the richest man in America, Argus finds himself with no memory of the murder and in a psychiatric ward.  But how do you prove the world is out to get you when you're a diagnosed paranoid schizophrenic?  It's not real, it's only paranoia, right?Eric Christopherson's debut novel is a psychological thriller with twists and turns.  Is he paranoid?  Is it real?  He easily blurs the reality line in Cracked-Up.  Christopherson is masterful with his descriptions of what being a paranoid schizophrenic would be like.  I couldn't tell what was real and what was ""an episode"" at certain points.  I was sure Argus Ward had ""Cracked-Up"" and then I was sure he was sane and so the cycle went until the end.

Lissa Matthew's came out with a book called Masked and mentioned on her blog that one of the main characters, Thor, was in this book. So after I finished Masked, I pulled this book out of the archives to read it once again.Aidn is a much sought after Dominant in a local club called Abyss. After a traumatic split with a submissive years ago, he only takes on trainees and one-night submissives. But he has come to realize he is bored with the same things and vanilla just isn't for him any more. Unfortunately, he has a hard time reconciling this with himself.Bailey is coming into her own. After not being able to work out her marriage, she has divorced and started her own bakery business. She knows Aidn from causal meetings at the Abyss, but never thought of him seriously knowing his reputation. When he approaches her outside of the lotion shop she can't believe he wants to have sex with her. She is comfortable with herself, but she knows not everyone is into larger women.They have a steamy afternoon in her place above the bakery. From the counter-top to the bed, they both believe this is just a one time affair, but Aidn gets the feeling she is the submissive for him and runs in fear. This is the theme for the story. She is ready to accept her submissive side and knows Aidn is the one, but Aidn can't let go of the past and continues to leave her several times during the course of this novella.While I understood why he had a hard time with what happened with his ex, it is no different from someone who gets a divorce. Eventually you have to get back up and if it falls in  your lap, you deal with it. He always seemed to be running and using Bailey and he knew it. I liked his character though. He struggled and eventually realized he needed to let go of the past. Bailey...I adore this woman and I want her frosting recipe. I can just imagine sitting down and eating a whole bowl of it.

Like a moth to the flame Louisa and Douglas are drawn to each other despite numerous reasons against their friendship.  Louisa is an extremely rich heiress who has inherited every unfortunate facial feature in her family.  She believes she looks as much like a horse as is humanly possible.  None of her suitors can see past the face to the person and beauty beneath; to her honesty, fairness, intelligence, and compassion.  They pursue only her fortune.  It shouldn't still hurt but it does and keeps her separate from everything and everyone, an outcast.Douglas is voluntarily an outcast and hermit when Louisa stumbles upon him in the hidden cave.  Douglas is also a vampire.  Not the traditional blood sucking variety either.  Really interesting and I've only read a few like him.  He can ""read"" Louisa's thoughts and know her inner self.  All her beautiful qualities are revealed to and cherished by him for their rarity.  For her part Douglas is always hidden in shadow so Louisa knows nothing of his looks, only what he reveals through actions and words.  Together Louisa and Douglas discover friendship that blossoms to more even as Douglas tries to shove her away.The difference between how we see ourselves and how we look to another when viewed through the eyes of love is the center of this wonderful story.

Robin falls in love with Simon over the course of their adventures because she realizes that he isn't what he seems.  Their romance blossoms and the author gives the reader a reminder of their first love, however there are several sex scenes in the book while not graphic I wouldn't want my young teen or teen reading the book.  I wish the author had created more of an adventure and less romance throughout the book, but that is only my opinion because I enjoy a good adventure and less romance.  I will however admit I did giggle like a school girl while reading the book several times.I also wish the author made Robin more physically strong and able to take care of herself and less I fallen and I can't get up.  Several times Robin talks about being able to take care of herself or knowing where she was going but instead she is lost or falling into quicksand or off the side of a mountain.  I feel it would have made Robin a bit more believable as a thief, the leader of robbers, if she was able to take care of herself.  I read this book remembering it is a self -published young adult novel and while it isn't going to win Pulitzer prize I think the author gave a fun take on a very old story.  It is a love story for the young adult who might not be ready for a strong adult romance but do not want to be stuck reading Disney romance story either.The author took lot of liberty in her choices of history, landscape and language used but at the same time it was an enjoyable teen\twenty something novel.  If you are looking for a quick summer romance with an adventure this book Royal Rebel is for you.Thanks Heidi for this review.","09 3, 2012",A1A8QJ282YIUQ0,"Book Him Danno ""Book Him Danno""",A good retelling of a great old story.

10585,3486,B001VLXMB6,"[76, 77]",4,"THIS is why I love my Kindle...three great books for the price of one.  After reading the reviews I thought the Julia Grey trilogy would be worth reading, and for $10 I was willing to gamble on the omnibus edition.  It was a good bet.The Julia Grey books are hybrid mystery-romances set in the Victorian period, best suited to readers who enjoy both genres.  Mystery is the dominant element in each book, but the romance between Julia Grey and Nicholas Brisbane is the backbone to the trilogy.  The slow, methodical development of the mysteries is nicely counterbalanced by the tempestuous relationship that develops between Julia and Brisbane.  The writing is elegant and rich, and it was a real pleasure to immerse myself in it.The omnibus contains all three books in the trilogy:SILENT IN THE GRAVE - This introduces us to our heroine, Lady Julia Grey, and begins with her husband's murder.  As the winning first line of the novel tells us: ""To say that I met Nicholas Brisbane over my husband's dead body is not entirely accurate. Edward, it should be noted, was still twitching upon the floor.""  Julia had been quiet, obedient, and dull all her life - the freedom of widowhood sparks a journey of self-discovery.  When Julia realizes her husband was murdered, more than a year after he died, she is determined to find the killer - no matter how cold the trail.  To succeed, she needs the help of Nicholas Brisbane, the private investigator her late husband hired before his death to investigate a series of ominous threats.SILENT IN THE SANCTUARY - This second book takes place at the family seat in Sussex, a converted abbey in the dead of winter.  The novel is richly atmospheric - a holiday party is trapped inside the fantastical gothic structure during a terrible snowstorm.  One among them is murdered, and another must be the culprit.  There are gypsies, ghosts roaming the stone-flagged halls, secret passages, impecunious relatives and a talking raven named Grim.  But SILENT IN THE SANCTUARY turns these gothic cliches on their heads as Julia and Brisbane race against time to find the murderer before the snow melts.SILENT IN THE MOORS - Like the second book, this one picks up - and transforms - a cliche: a dark, ominous, half-ruined estate in the northern moors of Yorkshire, capped by a rotting manor house, where dark family secrets fester.  Brisbane has acquired the estate, and his letters back to London indicate that something is very wrong - although he won't say exactly what.  Julia makes the journey north to investigate her relationship with Brisbane, and provide what help she can.  She's soon caught up in a proper mystery, featuring a family of aristocrats ruined by pride and a pair of mummified corpses hidden in a monk's hole.I devoured the trilogy.  The atmosphere of each book is wonderfully distinct and Raybourn does a wonderful job setting the scene - it's full of rich period detail, and everyone has a story to tell.  The whole cast of characters is magnificent, including every single member of Julia Grey's rather large family - she's one of ten children.  Although I sometimes solved the whodunit a little early in the story, Raybourn usually isn't content with just one crime: there's usually a tangle of them, and always had to wait for the end to see every detail unraveled.Brisbane is a dark, dangerous, mysterious sort of hero - easy to fall for, but terribly frustrating.  Sexy as he is, at times I really wondered if he was worth the trouble.  The romance is stretched out over all three volumes, and Julia and Brisbane's relationship is at least nominally professional - readers will be panting after the cracks in their professional facade.  At the end of the day, I still wished Brisbane had been a little warmer - and I am usually a big fan of brusque, brooding heroes.I started the trilogy expecting something along the lines of Dorothy Sayers, but the homage was really towards the Bronte sisters, Gothic mysteries, and maybe a dash of Sherlock Holmes.  All in all, highly recommended.","10 15, 2009",AXHEVH3H93VV7,Erin Satie,"delicious mystery-romance hybrid, with a lovable heroine and a swoon-worthy detective",1255564800
6068,2815,B001LWV4DS,"[2, 2]",4,"When I started reading this book. I couldn't stand Riccardo at all. He was a selfish, arrogant, shallow snob. It didn't make any difference that he was a rich, handsome sex god because his character was hard to take. Charlie was an innocent 18 year old who was quickly falling for him. She had lied to Riccardo and said she was 24, so he had no problem taking her virtue. Riccardo leaves his vineyard where he and Charlie were involved for a few weeks. He never told her that he was actually the owner of the place and when he leaves on the pretense of visiting his mother Charlie follows. At this point, she doesn't know she's pregnant with his child but when she arrives at his mothers palatial home both Riccardo and his mother treat her like trash, and she leaves. 8 years later she has to show a large estate to a client and guess who? It's Riccardo and she takes one look and passes out. That was disappointing because for someone who's been playing the radio loudly in the car for the last eight years of her life to block out the memories of Riccardo you would think she would have been thinking what she would do if she ever ran into him again. So she wakes up and yes she tortures the hell out of him but not nearly enough for the pain, he and his mother cost her. However, even with her having somewhat of a back bone and Riccardo being a block head the story and the book were extremely good and just to see Riccardo eat crow at the end was worth the price of the book. I recommend it highly.","11 24, 2009",A2EI4VOT1F8V62,"A Romance Junkie ""Mady""",A Romance Junkie,1259020800

If this is a self-published work then it's on a par if not better than most of the mass market romance novels out there.The authour took great care to create these two intriguing characters. Jarath is believable, likeable, and not too perfect like most romance book heroes (he drinks too much) thanks to being married to a scheming witch for the so long.I loved the way Brianna jumped into Alexandra's life through the clouds, and straight into giving birth. Ouch! Then she takes the rest of the book to convince Jarath she isn't really Alexandra, just in Alexandra's body, all the while falling in love.Her modern atributes like jogging are really cute, although I was interested to find out more about her former life before she went into the past. I'm sure there was a reason wny this was never mentioned, other than she didn't lead a very interesting life, but what kind of job she had or a bit about any family she might have left behind might have been interesting.Even though it's been a while now since I actaully read it, I am recalling a great deal, and another good thing about this book was that it didn't get bogged down with pages and pages of sex secenes like so many of the current roamnces seem to, which meant the authour wanted to tell the story about this relationship's developement, rather than take the easy way out by describing erotic sex scenes.","03 18, 2010",A2HX87JHRE6IOB,"meloco ""meloco""",A Beautiful Love Story,1268870400

I've way overspent my book buying budget since getting a kindle so had to focus on free down loads recently and frankly,  even for free most are too expensive - they are a waste of time!

She's not quite clear why he married her,  but she loves him,  and he's gorgeous but so gentle in bed.  He has dreams and desires he dares not bring to her... until she stumbles into his secret chamber,  and all is revealed.Actually the entire piece is basically a set up to the chamber scene,  the chamber scene,  which is entirely sexual and not hard core bdsm,  more light spanking and bondage,  and then ramifications of the chamber scene.  For a freebee it's excellent.  I see now that it's back to being $2.

They're hip, trendy, and current, and they're building a stellar name for themselves in the industry by focusing on quality entertainment. She is always on the lookout for promising new clients, but never had that promise held more appeal than when three utterly delicious men walk into the conference room. It may have been the worst sales pitch she'd ever heard, but the apparent front man of the three, a stunningly gorgeous man named Luke, stirs all sorts of juices in Lena. Despite the waste of time the meeting turns out to be professionally, she suggests a further discussion between the two of them that night over dinner.It wouldn't have been difficult for the dinner to go much better than the meeting had, but even Lena is surprised to find out that above and beyond how attractive she finds Luke physically, she is even more entertained by his companionship. Their chemistry is off the charts and the sex is phenomenal. There is, in fact, nothing that could dim the exquisite memory of the best night of her life...until she wakes up, rolls over, opens her eyes, and sees a seven-foot tall, winged, fanged, shaggy monster in bed next to her.That's pretty much when the screaming starts.Convinced some monster had eaten her new lover, Lena is both terrified and pissed, and it takes a hurt and embarrassed Luke a while to calm her down enough to explain that he hadn't been eaten and he is, in fact, a monster. And that he and his friends had come to her company in desperate hope that they could help launch a preemptive campaign to prepare humanity for their existence without sparking panic and causing the relentless slaughter of the last of his kind.Hollywood: gateway to public opinion and recent home to a sex god of a monster. Lena does so love that town.I have to admit, a quick read of the product description of the book before I downloaded it to my Kindle gave me the impression thatLights, Camera...Monstersis a paranormal romance. I should've payed closer attention to the warning, because this is definitely an erotic paranormal romance. It's an important distinction; a fact made crystal clear when I wasn't anticipated it. I'm not saying it's a bad thing. I like erotic paranormal romance. But in this case, it created a few problems for me.It's not just about the amount of sex in the book, which is a lot, or the level of graphic description, also a lot. Nor is it the light kink, which was fine. It was the fact that all of those things combined and became the largest part of the story by far, substituting romance for sex, eclipsing an anemic external conflict plot thread, providing virtually no character development, and overwhelming the limited world building and mythos creation.The concept of the story is a bit kitschy and kooky, but it is definitely original. The characters were ill-defined and two dimensional, but endearing (especially Luke). There was more than one plot hole, but the guilty pleasure I took in the humor and random bouts of comedy kept me from focusing too heavily on it. And the external conflict was appallingly bereft of development and was so quickly resolved it was laughable, yet...I can't deny that I found it all rather entertaining.I had a hard time believing that the monsters call their species monsters, though. That bothered me a lot, and didn't make a lot of sense in the big picture. They have their own language and their own culture, have hidden themselves away from people, but they define their species based on human preconceptions and labels? That didn't track for me.Yet despite the drawbacks, I found myself oddly drawn in and more than a little captivated by Luke in particular, whose intense efforts to fit in completely charmed me more than once. I wish there had been more time allotted to Luke and Michael and Henry together, because their scenes were showstoppers. And I didn't detest Lena, which is definitely a point in the books favor.In truth, I wish I had started the book with the advanced awareness of its erotic nature, because I think my expectations would have been different and I would have enjoyed the read even more. That being said, I can't complain at the price I paid (gotta love those free Kindle downloads), and don't feel like it was a waste of time. In fact, there was enough promise and potential in DuBois' writing that I'm interested in checking out the rest of the series in the hopes that the smutty, sexual, lightly kinky fun shares the page with a more well-rounded and better conceived plot and fully formed characters.Warning: This book contains graphic scenes of sex and alternative sexual situations including but not limited to: light BDSM, anal sex, and monster sex.

She and her friends get together every Friday night for some very specific girl time. Gathering around the window in her friend's apartment, lights off, snacks and drinks in hand, they look out the window and down into the apartment of the man they refer to as Mr. Tool.The man is smoking hot and has a habit of walking around his apartment barely clothed, sometimes not clothed at all (and aren't those happy nights!), with his lights on and his shades up. Hey, a girl's gotta grab whatever salacious fun she can, right? It's harmless and he's the man of her dreams - literally. Then she goes out to get some more booze for the girl's night and Mr. Tool confronts her about her and her friends' weekly activities.Mr. Tool...Gage for those who actually know him as more than just a bit of man candy, gives Hailey an ultimatum. Either she goes out on a date with him, or he calls the cops and files a complaint about her and her friends' weekly peeping.For six months Gage has been hoping for a chance with Hailey. She had moved out of the complex before he worked up the courage to talk to her, but he caught her and her friends spying on him one night and has gone out of his way to make sure she has plenty to see ever since. True, blackmailing the woman for a date isn't exactly the most gallant thing he's ever done, but it got the job done. Finally. Now, if he can just manage to get through the date without opening his mouth and sticking one or both feet into it.To say Gage is socially awkward around women would be a gross understatement. It makes starting a relationship hard, especially when he is as attracted to a woman as he is Hailey. A little blackmail seems a small matter for his pride, though, if it gets him a shot with Hailey.~*~This deliciously erotic little bit of yumminess was fun for a hot, quick read. The plot was a bit light, and I'm not sure I bought the whole gorgeous-guy-has-to-blackmail-a-girl-for-a-date concept, but the characters were likable and the sex was abundant and hot. Sometimes, that's all I need to be happy with an erotic novella like this.I liked that there was a surprisingly plentiful cast of secondary characters. The length of the story didn't give much room for them to be fleshed out very well, but spending time with Gage's family and Hailey's friends did add a bit of depth to both main characters. Depth that I enjoyed. I was amused by the relationship between Gage and his brothers and mother. Those weekly breakfast/guilt sessions and the sibling ribbings that went on seemed very natural to the characters and situations. I enjoyed them a lot.I wish that Harte had pushed the envelope of Gage's awkwardness around women even further, because he never really struck me that way when he was around Hailey. He certainly wasn't Mr. Charming, but to have built up the level of neurosis he had over his lack of ability to speak to women without saying something wrong, I would have expected him to be much, much worse than he was. Maybe if he'd been even more blunt, or less endearing with his clumsiness, I would have bought into it a bit more.Hailey didn't do much for me, really. She didn't annoy, but she's too familiar as the uptight, tightly wound Type A personality bordering on prissy. The girl with a killer bod and an ice maiden exterior fashioned from her fear of pain. I wish more originality had gone into her character, but she at least held her own.I'm not a fan of the quick-to-love theme in romance, even in erotic novellas. That, for me, was the bigger issue with the story. I wish the romance had been given a longer lead time, even if it had been in condensed form. I also would have liked a meatier plot, and I'm no fan of relationship conflict that's nothing more than a failure to communicate, as it was here. Those are the things that held me back from completely liking what I read.It was hot, though, I'll say that. And I do have a soft spot for the themes of unrequited love (or lust) and love (lust) from afar, like Gage had for Hailey. He was kind of geeky-cute with his affections and I enjoyed that aspect very much. For a quick read that will definitely raise a gal's body temp, I'd recommend this one, but I personally would have liked more story and a less annoying conflict.~*~*~*~Reviewed for One Good Book Deserves Another.","04 13, 2012",A2E9HDZXQORZLA,"Tracy ""One Good Book Deserves Another""",Sexy Little Bite of Yum,1334275200

It was sort of &#34;boy-centric&#34;story but I totally got into this book and loved it hard.Stan Morris's Surviving The Fog begins with a group of youths between the ripe ages of twelve and eighteen spending a three week stay at a summer camp retreat in the Sierra Nevada Mountains of California for an abstinence camp. They are there to learn about different birth control methods but ultimately to make a pact when faced with a sexual situation to take the high road and abstain. But shortly into their stay the Admin of the camp and the Counselors go lost and never return leaving roughly fifty youths with one counselor whose mental stability quickly devolves leaving them all alone. Knowing something very wrong has occurred thirteen year old Mike and his friend sixteen year old John attempt to make contact with the outside. When this fails they spearhead taking control of the camp before things get out of hand. It takes a while before a hierarchy is established but when it does, it is thirteen year old Mike who is the &#34;Chief&#34; of those left in the camp.When I started the book I had the odd feeling I was dealing with the set up of a 1980's slasher film. The young adults, isolated with the ominous feeling of impending suspenseful doom. Danger awaiting them and always a threat. After a couple of threats that feeling disappeared and something reminiscent of a happy telling of Lord of the Flies came to mind. Once it really got rolling I wanted more and more to keep going. I really didn't want to put it down.A whole lot happens in this book from point 'A' to 'B' and a good deal of detailed steps that add many dimensions to the large cast of young adult characters. Eventually, they come into contact with more people and their camp becomes the village of Petersburg--named for one of the founding members who helped establish peace at the camp at the start of the story. The happenings during the expansion will disturb many readers brought up in the black and white societal view delineating when a child becomes an adult. Also probably rural and urban upbringing will see the relationships that occur in this book differently as well. Many people will be offended or have argument with the later portion of the story.This story is a rather romantic view of communal living as a best possible outcome. Stan Morris's character's faith in human goodness and their ability to do what is best for one another in the face of a crisis is the vehicle that carries the story. For the most part the encounters with inhumanity that occur within the book are met with swift and severe punishment. It's the very definition of dura lex sed lex, the law is hard, but it is the law. However, in a times when humanity is tested, inhumanity will gather its forces. I really felt that there should have been a great deal more grief and strife. More uprising and usurping of power. The history of man does not really show a history of peace. Most of man's time on earth has been spent in bloodshed and a thirst for domination.The book had many issues which need a tune up. As good as the novel is it is just a little too long; it needed to be edited down just a bit so it wasn't so heavy to shoulder. I had no real beef with the simple writing style. Many might complain that Stan Morris's writing is too basic or undeveloped but for this book. The narrative being that of a thirteen year old boy, I truly thought he hit the nail on the head. The novel was too male centric and desperately needed to be balanced by more active respected female characters. I also felt that despite the pairing of couples that there never seemed to be any rhyme or reason for those relationships. I think he could have worked on developing a better psychological connection between them so it wasn't as dry and clinical as it came across.I wish I knew of books to compare this too but in my mind it really stands alone. I do recommend it and I'm suggesting it as a Weekend Pick Me Up but this one is one for a snowy or rainy weekend where you need to be taken away and forget this world for a little time. (This review was written for my blog All The Things Inbetween at Alicrean.com)Kathy's Synopsis:Kathy&#8217;s Recollections is about a group of teenagers attending a camp in the Sierra Nevada Mountains.  The camp was designed to preach abstinence and teach methods of birth control.  After a week, the cell phones are not connecting, and the mail has not been delivered, so the camp administrator and most of the counselors leave for a short visit to a nearby convenience store.  They never return.  After another week it become clear to one boy that something has gone seriously wrong in the world.  Then the campers discover that they are surrounded by a mysterious brown fog that appears to cover the earth below 6,700 feet.  The story is narrated by fourteen year old Kathy.  She focuses on their efforts to survive the elements, outsiders, and each other.","01 24, 2014",A12LBZWQYC74EU,"Ali Crean ""~Blogger: All the Things Inbetween""",Weekend Pick Me Up - Surviving The Fog by Stan Morris,1390521600

The Guild  hunters are human bounty hunters hired by angel masters to retrieve errant vampire servants attempting to skip out on the hundred years of service that is the price angels charge for immortality.Singh has carved out a nice little vignette for this story and she does a really good job of fleshing out her starring pair:  Guild Hunter Ashwini, who is dangerous and a bit on the crazy side, and Ashwini's favorite target, Cajun vamp Janvier who is her ally and not her prey for this hunt. Both these characters were wonderful and the flirtation between the two makes me hope that Singh won't wait too long to give them a full length novel of their own since Angel's pawn is just a tease for the pair and their relationship is left ` to be continued'.

I enjoyed that full length novel so much that I had to start from the beginning with the novella that started it all, and while I admit I enjoyedThe Ghost Exterminatorquite a bit more, The Ghost Shrink, The Accidental Gigolo & The Poltergeist Accountant was cute and fun.Lucy Cartwright is a medium, but she's been sexually frustrated for so long that her energy is connecting the most prurient ghosts to her for help transcending, and frankly, she's getting a little fed up with short, balding, overweight accountant-type ghosts stripping down in her bedroom and bumping and grinding their way towards her bed. A call to her boss for help with the embarrassing situation ends with a suggestion that Lucy rid herself of her frustration to rid herself of the horny ghosts. To put it bluntly...and a bit crassly...she needs to get laid.Considering that the helpful, if difficult to take care of at the drop of a hat, suggestion came from her boss, it wasn't Lucy's fault that she assumed the tall, dark, and delicious-looking male who banged her...er...banged ON her door the next morning was an...employee bonus from the boss. He introduced himself as Cox, after all. Imagine her mortification, then, when she realizes that Jake Cox not only isn't a gigolo that her boss set up to help her out, he's a private investigator and the brother of said boss.Really, would becoming one of those horny ghosts be SO bad after she dies from embarrassment?Jake needs Lucy's special brand of help and Lucy needs special help, full stop. And they both want each other badly. Toss in a couple of horny, pathetic ghosts and a murder investigation and you have the fun, silly romp that is The Ghost Shrink, The Accidental Gigolo & The Poltergeist Accountant.It's a light read, and it's told with Andrews' quick-witted and carefree style that goes down so easily. As a novella, it lacks in the depth of plot and character definition areas, though enough is provided for some fun. My only real problems with it were that it was a bit too light for me, almost slapstick, and Lucy and Jake's seismic-level attraction was a bit shallow for my tastes. There just wasn't enough time in the story, which even for a novella leans more towards the shorter end, to develop a relationship between them that was based on anything but physical attraction, so that didn't quite work for me.Still, this is a novella that isn't supposed to be taken too seriously, just enjoyed for what it is. It may not have been totally to my taste, butThe Ghost Exterminatordefinitely was, and I've already downloadedThe Sexorcist, which is the third book in the series and the second full-length novel.

You never know. It could happen.1. Strong Main Character/ Female Heroine: Lhung is a bit girly at times, but he comes off as a weird man. I am not sure what to make of him. He is mysterious and I am interested in finding out more about him. He seems like he is fighting some kind of inner demons and I like inner demons. 4 out of 5 stars2. Strong Minor Characters: Taus is intriguing. I want to know more about this mysterious girl with the gorgeous violet eyes. At times, I find her very dark and menacing, but she switches quickly back into a pretty little girl. I do not know if that is the author's intention or not, but I find it very compelling and interesting. I love her vulnerability mixed in with some naivety. She is the perfect foil to Lhung and I hope that he does not mess things up with her and that he pursues her. 5 out of 5 stars3. The Setting: There are a few different places that the author takes you to, but mostly the graphic novel is centered on the characters and how they look. I think if the author would add more of a setting to her book, it would make the novel more interesting to read and discover the world in which her characters live. 3 out of 5 stars4. The Plot: I wish there was more of a plot, besides the little love story in the making, but this is only the first chapter so I can hardly fault the author with that. I just wish there was a little bit more background information about Lhung being a dragon, because this concept is very confusing for me and I am really into the fantasy genre. I like how that mysterious man showed up and I want to know more about him. 3 out of 5 stars5. The Artwork: The characters are beautifully created and the precision just blows my mind. I do not know how the author can create such beautiful drawings and they really are a sight to see. Her drawings are better than a lot of Chinese, Japanese, and Asian graphic novelist. The use of color is very important in this novel, because the author uses color so rarely. So I cannot help but think and notice that the colors are very important to the book and holds special emphasis and hidden meaning. This is not your little brother's comic book. This graphic novel is for mature readers; however at this point, there are not any erotic moments to deem it XXX. 5 out of 5 stars6. The Writing: Okay, I will admit that at times the writing needs a little work, nothing a little proofreading would not cure, but other than that, I found the writing is satisfactory enough for a graphic novel. I do find that the writing lacks style or distinction as a unique work by the author; however, since the author's specialty is in creating beautiful artwork, you cannot expect the writing to be just as good as a novelist. 4 out of 5 stars7. The Dialogue: Sometimes, the dialogue can seem a little forced and slow going. I understand that this is only the first chapter and that the main attraction is the lovely artwork, but I believe that the dialogue needs to hold the reader's attention as well. A little improving an this graphic novel would be excellent and a perfect 5 star. 3 out of 5 starsThe overall rating is 3.86 out of 5 starsReading this graphic novel has inspired me to come up with three new categories to critique.

Teams are disappearing on missions, yet events that demand their attention are on the rise in frequency and intensity. After sending out every spare group of people, even the main office's administrative staff, they bring in a misfit crew to investigate a mysterious phone call received just that day from an agent who disappeared 20 years ago from a small town called Excelsior Springs.Set in the modern day, this story is not focused on Egyptian mythology, despite the description and the intro chapter. I found this to be action-packed and interesting. The banter between the teammates is natural and often humorous. The setting in Excelsior Springs, including the history involved, is also impressive. I was surprised and pleased with the historical fiction aspects of the story, many of which involved this little town. It was clever to link a famous historical figure with O4S, though I don't want to say who the figure is due to spoilers. The old hotel and the alternate old hotel are both extremely creepy, especially due to the creatures and ghosts that inhabit them.Murphy, Bill and Kate are my favorites from the team. Murphy, the detective, is a sceptic; even after he finds himself transported to another dimension, he still refuses to believe, though he deals with what he's experiencing. Bill monitors, records and coordinates the efforts of the team as they investigate. He pops in with humorous remarks and seems to be their tether to the real world. Finally, Kate, the apprentice mage who thought she was simply coming for her first training mission, instead finds herself on a desperate mission, facing terrifying enemies.And those terrifying enemies are numerous and varied. Counted among them are ghosts, demons, immortal serial killers, and the particularly nasty spirit that spawned The Order of the Four Sons in the first place.Overall, I really enjoyed this story, particularly the historical fiction and the ongoing battle between good and evil. This is the first in a series, so the book ends off with a set up for the next one.

But I eventually decided that I'd like a cover/case that completely encloses and cushions the Kindle, as I tend to carry it around a lot, toss it in the car during trips, etc.  So I bought the Belkin Neoprene Sleeve Case after seeing and reading about it on Amazon.  And, happily, it turned out to be a great purchase, handsome and functional.  I especially like the way the cushioning inside isolates the Kindle from the zipper, so there's no danger (unless you're really, really careless, or maybe drunk) of scratching your Kindle while zipping or unzipping the case.And even though this is a soft product, there's just enough stiffness to the Belkin Case to prevent the material from settling down and sitting on the Kindle screen when you place the covered device down somewhere.  Though there's really no harm if that does occur, as the Kindle sits snugly in the case and won't move around and create friction between the inside surface and the screen.So, yeah, this is a very nice product, and it's economically priced, to boot.  Why not five stars, then?  Well, unlike the stiff official K2 cover, this is still a soft case that won't allow you to safely place anything of weight on top of it, so the Kindle will always have to be on top of any pile of things you're carrying or placing in a carry-all bag.  And I always have to take the extra, perhaps slightly inconvenient, step of making sure my grip is pressuring the keyboard area, not the more sensitive screen area, when I'm carrying the case around.  But these are quibbles.  There's yet to be a Kindle case or cover that perfectly addresses all concerns, and maybe it's not realistic to expect one.So, for now, if you're looking for a cushioned case that completely protects the Kindle from weather, scratches, minor bumps, and other things along these lines, you can't go wrong with the Belkin Case.","03 18, 2009",A3GRN6J64F2C3X,"Joseph P.

It starts off with a battle and the action continues throughout.  The author has created a post apocalyptic fantasy world with a unique twist and very engaging characters.The heroes, Marc and Blake, and the heroine, Kate, find themselves fighting on the same side against the demons set on destroying the world.  The emotional drama the characters find themselves in draws the reader into the story as Marc and Blake join Kate's military group to try to close the demon rip, and find themselves attracted to Kate. They each try to get her attention as they deal with their own personal issues with each other. Kate is equally attracted to them both, but doesn't know what to think or do about that, besides she is on a mission and doesn't need the complication.The reader's attention is also captured by the depth the supporting characters add to this drama filled story.  The well written battle scenes come to life in this intriguing tale and you can feel the chemistry building between the three main characters.  The sex in the story is very hot and leaves the reader wanting more.The author leaves us with not only a war cliff hanger, but a romantic cliff hanger as well, but she left us a great spot in the story.

HKW breaks apart the sometimes stale archetypical vampire mythos and manages to create a daring action-packed story in Redeemer.Well-researched biblical lore here.  The author states in the Foreward that she holds a degree in Religious Studies, and it shows.  Believers may be challenged by a premise that appears blasphemous.  After first reading the Amazon reviews, I wondered just how open-minded I would be?  HKW does a great job in cross-fertilizing the paranormal and biblical themes.  However, her somewhat negative viewpoint on religion in general may be off-putting to some readers.This was a page-turner for me.  Lots of twists and turns in the plot and the characters were well-defined and likeable.

At times, the novel reminded me of a mix of Indiana Jones and Stargate and, at other times, like supernatural stories of demons and ghosts.The characters were each distinct and there were many characters from different groups. At first, I didn't think I could keep track of them all, but each character developed his own persona as the book progressed and after a while it wasn't necessary to be told who was talking, from the natural-born leader, the Colonel, to the practical and knowledgeable policeman Murphy to the inexperienced novice Kate. This was true of the main group. Then, there were the baddies and the FBI. Some characters also had other names or variations on their names. Some sections were a little confusing and had to be re-read.The quest of finding a piece of the staff of Solomon was similar to finding clues in a good mystery novel. After reaching each one, the reader was anxious to read more. I found myself thinking about the story each time I laid the book down until I picked it up again, mostly trying to keep the characters and timeline straight.Different stories were weaved throughout the book from different times and different people as the story unfolded. Some sections of the story took place in a castle in the 16th century and others in the wild west with Frank and Jesse James while others were in modern times with a storyline of ritual killings. This presented no problem because the first paragraph provided enough clues that the reader knew who it was and what was going on, with the headings of the segment of the story being prefaced by the date. This was used as a mechanism to mete out all the information in spurts throughout the book, a way of showing how everything within the novel developed through time to the present day. It was a good technique and kept the reader from being overloaded with information.I prefer novels to have a definite conclusion, but this book is intended to be the first in a series and left the reader at a point where he or she wants to read the next book and the next or however many more there are until the story ends. As I said, if you like action and adventure, magic, ghosts, demons, quests and serials, you will enjoy this book.","06 24, 2013",A2KPIGI8Y25SRQ,Amber Fox,Fast-Paced Paranormal,1372032000

But Niko's not as unaffected by the delectable and funny Twyla as she thought...and her ""vacation"" surely isn't going to go as smooth as she'd hoped when she realizes that someone's trying to turn all the vampires in NYC into slavering, bloodthirsty beasts as the ball drops on the New Year and Twyla and Niko are the only two who can stop a madman from destroying them all.Points to Hughes for delivering a very well-rounded story in such a short format. There's even a bit more character development than I'd anticipated - and something that's so often lacking in stories of this length. Admittedly, I've read the first two books, so I'm already familiar with Hughes' world and vampire mythos, and I DON'T think that the book would read nearly as well for someone who isn't, so I rate it four stars for lacking any real world building at all. Other than that - very well told.","03 19, 2010",A2E9HDZXQORZLA,"Tracy ""One Good Book Deserves Another""",Solid Addition to the Series,1268956800
9657,8352,B002VFPSD6,"[2, 3]",4,"Here I am again, reviewing another of Lanyon's novella-length stories and once again, I can't express strongly enough my appreciation for his technical skill, his intelligence and wit with a plot and characters, and his ability to draw me into the world with strong, believable happenstance. And in The Dickens With Love, Lanyon shines especially bright for adding a surprising amount of depth and backstory to the lead character, James Winter. Novella's are often hampered by their very nature, but in this, Lanyon rose above those limitations to provide an exceptionally well rounded character. His romantic lead, a Mr. Sedgwick Crisparkle, was perhaps NOT so fully defined and fleshed out, but was still superior to many two dimensional characters in novella-length stories.Add in a sweet holiday melancholy and yearnings for respectability once had and now lost and a measure of growth for James' character, and this lovely tale just shines like one of those starburst or starlight drinks Sedge favors so much. Which sounded delicious by the way...if a bit monsterously strong. The ""excerpts"" from the ""Christmas Cake"" were charming little surprises that lent an air of reality to the story as well. As I've said in a previous review of a novella-length Lanyon story, the only critique I truly have is that the romantic aspects of this m/m holiday romance don't quite touch me on as deep an emotional level as I'd hoped, but I still believe that's more due to the limiting nature of the length of the story than any failure on Lanyon's part. I admit...I'm cynical and don't believe in love developing within days or hours, so when the story spans such a time, it's hard for me to buy into a love-at-first-Dickens whirlwind romance.But top-notch storytelling, as always, for Lanyon.","03 10, 2010",A2E9HDZXQORZLA,"Tracy ""One Good Book Deserves Another""",My Fondness of Lanyon is Becoming Die-Hard,1268179200

Numerous specific crimes are mentioned, along with very specific punishments. Most of the crimes revolve around things dealing with farming, buying and selling things, and debts.Punishments ranged from paying a fine (in money or goods/animals), to somewhat much more severe, like having a hand cut off, all the way to death. Some of the things I found most interesting are as follows:Threaten a witness? You die.Judge makes a mistake in giving the penality? Out of a job.Steal. Depends who you steal from. If you're rich, you pay 30 times the amount stolen; if poor, you pay ten times the amount stolen. The laws seemed to be fairly balanced in this way, the penalty in money or goods higher for the rich person than for a poor person.If a woman opens a wine house? She dies.If a wife has sex with some other guy and is caught, they are tied together and drowned.If a wife is very ill, the guy can take another wife but must still take care of the first one.If a son has sex with his mother and they are caught, both are burnred to death.If a son strikes a father, one of his hands is cut off.If a guy causes another guy to lose an eye or break a limb, the same will be done to him.If a guy hits a pregnant woman and she dies, thus losing the baby, then, if the guy has a daughter, she dies.There's also a whole section on the fees various people can charge, including doctors, vets, house builders and ship builders.All-in-all a very harsh system of laws, but in some ways, especially the rich paying a much stiffer penalty than the poor, most fair than today's laws.","08 2, 2013",A1NDYD4JKKY9LE,"Sarah Marie ""sarah_marie""",Harsh laws but some fair points,1375401600

It is a gripping story about sex slavery, focusing on Callie, aka Mischief, a young girl kidnapped while vacationg in Europe. The tale is told by her, first in her current situation where she is being held by the police who are trying to figure out who she is and what is wrong with her; and secondly about her time in the facility called Judgment.I do not normally enjoy flashbacks in my books, but they are present throughout this one, and I found them to be short and extremely important to the rest of the story. Mischief has undergone extreme conditioning, over the span of ten + years, which explains her behavior with the detectives. The rest of the book is spent describing her experiences at Judgment, which consisted of many colorfully described beatings with just about every implement available by just about every Master in the place (and there are quite a few).There is some sex here and there, and even a quick f/f scene, but it isn't focused on or described nearly as much as the overall behavior modification and the techniques the Masters employ to produce ""finished products"" for sale. The girls move up through several rankings, the ""luckier"" ones become Personals (personal slaves to the Masters).I loved this story (something maybe wrong with that, I don't know), but I just couldn't put it down until I knew how things turned out one way or the other.

It reads more like a novella, which is fine, as it suited my mood at the time, but I think it should probably be labelled as novella rather than a novel. For me, a little more depth and length is required to truly merit the label novel and this lack of depth is what caused any disappointment I felt in the book.I liked Blind Malice enough,though, that I will certainly read more installments in the series and can recommend this first one to anyone who loves plants, flowers and gardening. That's where the author truly knows her stuff and shines most brightly.","03 24, 2011",A1BC6D94NAFZL5,Annie B,Enjoyable debut,1300924800

No real violence, TONS of sex- no BDSM, but multiple partners.I'm a fan of Ms. Arand's ""Granite Lake Wolves"" series and decided to read other books she has out there and I've been pleasantly surprised, though the Wolves are still the better books- sweeter stories, deeper histories, better characters.

I can't, maybe I should pay attention to those more often?

Ms. Holley, no rush or anything, but can I have some more?REVIEW: Incest is best...put your sister to the test. I think that was like some stupid phrase in grammar school or something. Lark and Taran call themselves cousins, but Taran is more like an older brother since Lark actually lived with his mother after her parents died. Technically they are not related at all, but that still doesn't make Lark feel better about her hot fantasies that she has about Taran and the flame that she has been holding for him for like, ever.When Lark gets herself in a bit of trouble with some Euro wolves, a little GHP and an attempt on her life, Taran, who is now a Houston PD detective takes it upon himself to protect Lark. Close quarters and heated emotions might play a little too much for them though, as secrets come out - and hidden feelings are revealed.Can I get a Taran of my own? Yum. This was definitely a fun and entertaining read. I am a fan of both the hero and heroine and all that went along with them. The book kept me glued throughout, not one dip into boredom with this one. Great thing about the kindle on my iPhone - reading in the line picking up the Drama Queen, reading at the football game, reading at the line in the grocery store...reading while I'm doing that web upload at work.

That's it, though, wasn't that big of a deal. The main feature was resolved, so that is all that mattered.RECOMMENDATIONS: Adults only, a lot of happy coupling. PNR fans, werewolf fans should enjoy.

But when she stirs feelings inside him, Ryan realizes that one decadent night of m&eacute;nage was enough and now he wants her all to himself. Finding that time and understanding that they were on the same wavelength only reinforces his feelings.To Ryan's surprise, what starts out as hot sex turns into something deeper.

Aubrey is still damaged from the betrayal of her now ex-husband, and since their divorce she doesn't have relationships with men. She dates and has sex.

The story is tightly compact, but due to the length, we get a much better idea of Aubrey as a character than we do Price, who never seems to develop much beyond superficial eye candy. I've read other novellas of this length that focused more on both character's definition, and realize that my preference lies in that area. I'm not criticizing this story, don't get me wrong. I think it was comprehensive, given length-constraints, in detailing Aubrey's character enough to lend her believability, and I enjoyed seeing her interact with her friend the hairdresser and the guardian angel. In fact, had Price's character been given just a bit more definition, I would have really liked this story.

Enough to irritate and detract from this reader's enjoyment.Opinion:A very relationship-driven erotic romance following our Goldilocks as she takes on her three were-bears. Not a menage - Oriana never takes on more than one bed partner at a time - but highly erotic and varied as the Men show their different tastes. I liked Oriana - she was sweet and caring and very willing to go with the flow. She needed somewhere to just *be* and someone to simply love her. Getting three sexy men just makes it all the more fun. It's enjoyable, nicely written, and an easy way to pass the time.3.5 stars because of the editing issues, rounded up to 4 because Fanning made Goldilocks work, and made me laugh.Aside:Reminded me a lot ofMikayla's Menby Abby Blake - a sweet, easy woman who just wants to find a comfortable place to be loved. And her men who have differing needs and are simply looking for a woman to care for, protect and nurture.-CR-","02 24, 2012",A1ZN2JLLR9GI3T,cathyr,"""not to sound all mother goose or anything, but there's some blond chick in my bed""",1330041600

It left me with the feeling that not too much happened.The world seemed a bit thin and there were few compelling allusions to anything greater and deeper churning within the as-yet-untold-story behind the story.I waffled a bit between a 3 & a 4 rating, but I did enjoy the read, so I opted for the 4.As other commenters mentioned, there's a lot of hiccups to the writing due to incorrect grammar and occasionally the narrative will shift very temporarily to first person and jolt the reader out of the story.There's also that horrible horrible war between 'effect' and 'affect' that is rampant within this book.  These words are commonly misused within the book, which obviously irritated other reviewers more than it did me, yet I was not completely immune.What bothered me more was the lack of characterization and rationale for the actions of certain characters.  Some characters seemed stupid-angry simply because it was the only way to advance the plot in the direction the author wanted.Obviously I liked the book in certain ways.  I liked the main character.  I liked the process in which he began making a place for himself in his world.  I liked the relationships he had with several of his peers (and I liked several of those peers).  I liked the general description of the world.  I even liked the beginning of the main conflict, and a bit of the middle of the main conflict (though it seemed to drag on at some points).The question is how much promise does this author and this series have?  Will I pay $2.99 for the second book in the series?Right now I'm leaning against it.But if my current stash of $0.99 fiction runs dry, it will be in the realm of possibility.","07 1, 2011",A259Q7R79WRGOY,"Brian Chrisman ""fooburger""",Not as much to go on as I hoped...,1309478400

Another sensual novella that continues the tale of the unusual alliance between the Weres, Vampires, Unborn and Igigi. Liz has continued her life even though Malcolm is no longer around physically to help her in her care for the Unborns that she has sheltered. Her inexplicably carnal response to a mysterious being whom she dubs as `Midnight' makes her realize that she did not die along with Malcolm (although she somehow still hears his voice in her head) and she gradually learns to distinguish between loving and being in love with someone. The concerted effort to destroy the fragile alliance being brokered by Zander and his connections reveals that the Shadow Wolves have a insidious plan that is being directed by a surprising leader. Betrayals and shocking discoveries make it more important than ever to utilize all of the resources available, unfortunately ensnaring the offspring of Zander and Regina as well as those of Lux, Sylvain and Arygon in the dangerous battle. The ill-fated lovers Jasyn and Hannah must face their personal demons and acknowledge their true heart's desires as the allies race to save Nicolette from her fate. The destiny of all of their races may rest on the results of a single epic battle.Another searingly sensual tale in the series that features wonderful cameos by the intriguing beings who have been introduced in the first three novellas in this mesmerizing series. The deft weaving of multiple threads that have persisted throughout the love stories already presented make some of the long-awaited revelations startling yet believable. The scorching scenes between the various lovers is an added benefit to a enjoyably creative series and there are enough dangling threads to make one hopeful that there will be many more stories to follow.

Risks that have finally spilt over to Colt and Heath when Colt comes home early from work one evening and finds Kylie's date getting too rough in the bedroom and hurting her.  Colt and Heath decide that Kylie needs room to experiment with men that she can trust so they offer her their sexual services for a weekend of no-holds-barred sex for all three of them.

She took her time to decide that she wasn't ready to commit to marriage to her beau in Arizona and decided to give up a good job that she'd held for 16 years and move back to where her roots are in the Blue Ridge Mountains of North Carolina.  I also chose this book because I've been all through the Blue Ridge Parkway many times and it brought back nice memories of such beauty.Once Rachel gets about halfway settled in, her friend Isaac comes over to ask a favor of her.  A friend of his died by falling over a cliff to his death below, but police have ruled it either suicide or an accident, but Isaac knows in his heart it was neither.  He wants Rachel to do her own little investigation of this incident.  In between getting her house ready, her gardens done with the help of a landscaper, buying a new car, and meetings for her work, she manages to interview a lot of people who could be connected to Isaac's friend's death.  Some of them certainly have good motives, or at least it seems that way.One of the things I loved best about this book is the gardening and the discussions of the different kinds of flowers and plants that Rachel has.  I could just smell the lemon verbena (which is so hard to control!) and was amazed at the different kinds of hosta. Rachel is someone I could easily be friends with, and she would make a great conversationalist and just an all around fun friend.  There is humor in the book, tension, suspense and romance.

His heroes often tend to be introspective loners on the lam, and thus we get a strong psychological component. But, since Brand was paid by the word, there is also a tendancy toward wordiness; this, when combined with the aforementioned introspection, seems to prolong even the simplest actions.Brand wrote some good books; he was bound to writing so very much and in so many different genres. Indeed, many of his books (such as the Doctor Kildare series) are not westerns. But forced to churn out verbiage in magazine stories and short novels to make a living, too many of his tales seem perfunctory and more than a tad familiar, one to the next. And some plot devices are downright odd. That so many of hs books are as highly regarded as they are is certainly to his credit, but overall there is some hard-to-define quality (angst, perhaps?) about his western stories that doesn't particularly appeal to me; they somehow don't ring true. Nevertheless, for those who enjoy his stories, this set conveniently packages many of Brand's currently available public domain works.UPDATE 04-27-13: Wildside Press has just published a particularly well-formatted, 20-title ""Max Brand Megapack"" for only $.99.

I truly felt for Ryan as no one should have to go through what he did in the four years after his parents threw him out.

This was the first Serena Yates book I read but I don't think it will be the last.When Ryan got up his courage to tell his parents he was gay, they told him it was a sin and he would burn in hell for it. They threw him out and threatened his friends if he tried to get help from anyone. Ryan lived on the streets, he headed to Canada and has just barely made ends meet trying to stay away. He discovers his twin sister, Nicole, is marrying his best friend, Peter, and even though Ryan is terrified they hate him and want nothing to do with him, he has to see his sister on her wedding day.Daniel, Peter's older brother, can't believe his eyes when he finds Ryan on a park bench the night before the wedding. He looked so hard for Ryan when he disappeared, not believing his parents who said he ran away. Daniel, Peter and Ryan were always inseparable, regardless of the five year age difference, but the last few years before Ryan left, Daniel started to feel more. Can he convince Ryan to stay and make a life with him, because Daniel isn't going to lose him again.This is a fairly short story but well worth the read.

She's not looking for a lifelong love or even a long term relationship but she'd love to find a master who can bring out the full extent of her passion.Even after all this time Jane is still hurt by Peter's betrayal and knows trusting anyone with her heart or body will not be easy.  Her best friend and business partner Lily accompanies her to a bondage-themed event that their business R.S.V.P. is responsible for setting up.  It's more than just networking for Jane though, it's her first foray back into the BDSM scene and she just hopes to find one man who appeals to her.Once they arrive at the party location, Lily and Jean Jacques settle into their non-interested attitudes despite the fact that the sexual tension between them is practically off the charts.  Jane's just waiting for Jean Jacques to toss Lily over his shoulder and show her just what she's missing.  Jane spends the evening hunting for a potential master for the night but no one's sparked an interest.  What she doesn't realize is that Antonio Villareal spotted her the moment she entered the ballroom and he has every intention of getting to know her - in every way possible.Antonio isn't having the best of luck when it comes to women.  Sure, he's rich, gorgeous and single but women are only after him because of what they'd gain by being seen on his arm.  He's looking for a submissive woman to share his life and has set his sights on Jane.  The only problem is she's told him upfront she isn't looking for a happily-ever-after.  Some really hot sex in the here and now will do wonders for her but anything further is more than she's willing to consider.  Will Antonio be able to convince her that she can have all the smoldering sex she could ever want if she'd just give him a chance?Dominique Adair's storylines are ones that I'm consistently drawn to over and over.  Her plots and characters never fail to draw the reader into the storyline while promising to seduce you with each heat filled scene.  In SEDUCING JANE PORTER we're introduced to Jane, a character who's love and trust was horribly abused yet she's brave enough to attempt another foray into the BDSM world.  Antonio is exactly the sort of master Jane desires - even if she isn't aware of it yet.

8268,3225,B001ULBOTO,"[1, 1]",5,"This is book was just about a perfect read! Yes there were a few editing issues with this particular copy, but the product description clearly states that the book is a reproduction of a book published before 1923 and may have occasional imperfections, such as missing or blurred pages, poor pictures, errant marks, etc. In light of this proclamation, it amazed my that so many reviewers still took the time to complain about the typos.  They were present but did not in the least distract from the story, at least for me they did not.  Furthermore, I could not in any way tell that this book had been scanned.Phoebe Deane is an orphan who as a child went to live with her half brother, Albert Deane.  Albert is a mild mannered, kindly man who sees only the good in everyone.  He is also a bit of a dolt.  His wife Emmeline is the evil stepmother type from Cinderella.  She works Phoebe to death and never has a kind word for the girl.  She is also crass with very little education.  Truthfully, she is just plain jealous of the beautiful, refined Phoebe.  Hiram Green, a neighbor of the Deanes' wants to marry Phoebe, but she despises the very sight of him!  The hero, Nathaniel, is a lawyer and the nephew of Judge Bristol, one of town's most prominent members.  Nathaniel lives and works in New York City, but often visits with his uncle who helped to raise him.  The book is set in a small town in New York State some time in the 1830's.  Nathaniel meets Phoebe when he comes upon her in the woods where she is crying after having read a letter from her deceased mother.  Nathaniel is immediately taken with the beautiful, soft spoken Phoebe.  I loved Nate and Phoebe, but if I had to pick a favorite character it would be Miranda, Phoebe's friend and self appointed guardian angel.  Hiram is determined to marry Phoebe and refuses to accept her rejection of his proposal.  He and Emmeline conspire to get Phoebe to accept him as a husband and he literally begins to stalk the poor girl!  Everytime Phoebe left her house, Hiram would be there with his unwelcome presence.  Hiram took note of Nathaniel's attentions towards Phoebe and between that and her constant rejection of his suit he begins to hate her and Nathaniel and starts scheming against them.  All the while he is still determined to have Phoebe as his wife.  If not for the enterprising Miranda, he might very well have succeeded in his evil plot.  Other characters include Marcia and her husband David Spafford, the hero and heroine from the first book of the Schuyler trilogy entitled ""Marcia Schuyler.""  I have not as yet read that book, but have just been lucky enough to obtain a free copy and so intend to read that next.  I am also looking forward the 3rd and final book in the triology ""Miranda"" in which the beloved Miranda finally gets her love match.  This book invoked a wide range of real emotions in me.  I  lauged out loud at many of Miranda's escapades, I literally felt Phobe's pain and suffering, and I completely despised Hiram Green.  One scene in particular where he and Emmeline conspire to get Phoebe to travel alone with Hiram had me clenching my teeth and wishing I was there to kick Hiram's sorry ass!!!!  He gets his in the end though and very nicely too, thanks in part to Miranda, of course!  Love that girl! And of course, love conquers all when Nate and Phoebe get to sail off into the sunset to begin their happily ever after.  I highly, highly recommend this book.  Jane Austen lovers especially will love this book.  It is a nice clean truly romantic story that touched me deeply.","05 26, 2013",A310KT1UQC5UNU,Reading Fanatic (CMP),"Wonderful, Wonderful Story!",1369526400

Everything happens in one long sentence and at that point you have to go on to find out what happens next.The story is about an American who is forced to work for a Mexican gang who traffics drugs across the border with the United States. You see the character's ascent from common man, who must count on his expertise to make himself indispensable to his new ""boss"", thus avoiding his own death and that of her daughter, to expert trafficker and unscrupulous criminal.The rhythm is that an action story, but the suspense is typical of a thriller. While accompanying the character to his descent into hell, one wonders how he will ever get out of that situation, and from time to time our theories are proved wrong by the latest turn of events.The very title of ""Borderline Case"" has the double meaning of referring to a geographical border and to a borderline patient, emphasizing the dual reading of the story.Although told in third person, in fact, the novel follows almost exclusively the main character, Eric, except for some scenes, so you end up deeply understanding and sympathizing for him. The other characters are almost all portrayed in a rather superficial way, perhaps deliberately not to distract too much the reader from the main problem (the survival of Eric) and make sure they won't mind if they got killed.

As an accountant she would never strut about looking like an `X-rated Mrs. Claus, but with a little pleading and begging from her friend that's exactly what she's going to do.  Due to the illness that has been sweeping through Sugar Plums, a Christmas-themed strip club, Holly dons the Mistress Christmas getup - adds a velvet mask and struts her stuff for the crowd.Detective Nick West is on a mission.  Granted it's entirely off the clock since his friend didn't want to file a report about the supposed robbery that occurred at Sugar Plums.  He's dead set on taking down the thieving Mistress Christmas - until he gets a good look at her.  Now he's far more interested in uncovering all her secrets on a personal level than pursuing her in any legal manner.For Holly the freedom allotted along with anonymity is a real eye opener.  Especially once she meets Nick who promises that he's definitely more sinner than saint.  He's the epitome of all her sexual fantasies rolled into one tight, hot package that she would love to find under her Christmas tree tied neatly with a bow.  Reality is that as an accountant he would probably never give her a second look but she's incognito and as Mistress Christmas she's allowed to be more bold and daring than she'd normally dare.  Their first meeting is full of sexual innuendoes and Christmassy humor but it's the lap dance he insists on that really turns up the heat.  Nick is a little confused since as a seasoned stripper Holly should know the rules about touching or kissing during the session.  Instinctively he knows that Holly is innocent of wrongdoing but as a seasoned detective it's hard to let go of his concerns.When Holly confides her naughty Christmas wish well, Nick's certainly not going to disappoint her - especially when her wish is one night of sexual decadence ... with him!  Neither of them knows the truth about the other.  He believes her to be a stripper who may or may not be robbing the men she dances for and all she knows about him is he's a Wyoming cowboy who does lots and lots of paperwork in his current occupation.  Their deceptions may prove to be problematic in the future but for this one night, they're going to do far more than get tangled up in the tinsel.Lorelei James is certain to bring a smile to your face with this holiday inspired tale.  MISTRESS CHRISTMAS is full of smart and sassy characters, sexually charged situations, a little suspense, and plenty of chuckles.  Holly and Nick complement each other beautifully and I got a huge kick out of being privy to their relationship as it developed.  The whole time I was reading I wondered how Nick's `investigation' would turn out and I have to tell you it was nothing like I expected.  Ms. James certainly throws readers a curveball on that one.  This is a wonderful story and well worth adding to your keeper shelves.MISTRESS CHRISTMAS is the first story in a brand new series entitled the WILD WEST BOYS.  While I can't find anything about future releases in this series I'll definitely be on the lookout for them.  Will also be going back and reading the ROUGH RIDERS books since I discovered this series is loosely connected to them.Chrissy Dionne (courtesy of Romance Junkies)","11 30, 2009",A2AY83K9N60V38,"C.

A world where angels and vampires not only co-exist, but have an interesting connection. As a Guild Hunter, one of those that hunts rogue vampires down for the angels, Ashwini finds herself suddenly stuck between two vampire factions, and the angel wanting to manipulate them all, in Atlanta. She turns, for help, to Janvier, a vampire himself - who may have his own reasons for assisting her.From the first moment I started this novella I was immediately immersed in the world. I couldn't have stopped reading if there was a fire. Okay. I hope I could have at least paused to get out of the building, but you get the picture.I'm continually amazed by Nalini's ability to create fully realized characters, especially in novellas where the shortened format makes that difficult for a lot of authors. Angels' Pawn is no different. Ashwini is a compelling character from her first moments pounding on a door. I'm completely intrigued by her, and really hope that we get to see more of her in the future.Janvier. Wow. What can I say except I want to meet him. A native from the bayous, with an old world charm, and an, apparently, innate sexiness, he is just fantastic. Watching him play off of Ashwini, lightening the mood and at the same time ratcheting up their relationship throughout everything they were trying to accomplish in Atlanta was truly a joy.I can not wait to read Angels' Blood which focuses on Elena and Raphael, I believe. But I'm really hoping to see more from Janvier and Ashwini in the future. Their storyline was by no means complete - although the main conflict is tied up in the novella - we have lots more to hear about this pair.Nalini's said it, but I'm going to give this warning to those that need an HEA. This is not a typical romance with a bow-tied HEA at the end.It's a fantastic read, a great introduction, and I highly recommend it. If you've not read anything by Nalini Singh, I urge you to run out and buy everything you can by her.

10937,1285,B0015YEQ8W,"[2, 2]",5,"Belle Taylor has her life carefully mapped out.  She's been making goal oriented lists her entire life and never once has she failed to reach each milestone and feel a sense of accomplishment as she marks it off the `TO DO LIST.'  For the first time ever her goal of a plush corner office and her name on the letterhead of the law firm where she's been working has her considering altering her plans.  She's been working eighty hour weeks for the past year and Belle's just beginning to realize that the perks of her desired position may not be worth the sacrifices she's made.Rafe Bettencourt, Belle's brother Brian's best friend, has been a longstanding friend of the family and the object of Belle's fantasies since she was twelve years old.  It wasn't until five years ago that he began to view her as a desirable woman - before that she was simply Brian's little sister and a whole lot of fun to torment.  Rafe's perfectly aware of Belle's anal retentive, control freak nature but that's a trait he's begun to find very alluring about her - there's nothing he'd like more than to strip her naked and make her lose control.For the first time in a year, Belle has returned home to visit with her family for the holidays.  She's thinner and paler than she had been on previous visits and everyone points out the fact that she's had no time for herself, family, or anything else that makes life worth living.  Belle's perfectly aware of that fact but she's come so far and is so close to her goal - quitting now is simply inconceivable.  Rafe proves to be a delightful distraction from her own troubles as he tempts her to be naughty with him.  What better time to start up a little romance than Christmas and seeing as she'll be visiting for a full five days, he's determined to give her a good reason to make some adjustments to her `TO DO LIST.'  Adjustments that include him, a happily ever after, and all the organizing and list making she could ever desire - as long as he can seduce her into giving up her `dreams' of success in San Francisco.  Or had she already been coming to the conclusion that there's more to life than a corner office and empty apartment all on her own?  Rafe just may provide that extra push she needs to take the leap of faith and move one of her long term goals up a few notches.Lauren Dane will have readers smiling with this delightful tale of hope and promise.  TO DO LIST captures Belle's single-minded pursuit of her dreams and her lists with humor and a little sadness.  There's no doubt that she's well on her way to acquiring her goal, but she also realizes that it isn't worth giving up her `real' life to achieve and accepting that she isn't going to get to cross that goal off her list is difficult to accept.  Rafe is willing to accept Belle exactly as she is - organized shoes and all - but he's also aware that the path she's on is a destructive and lonely one.  Rather than try to tell her what she should do he presents her with feasible options which may make her happier.  I had a great time reading TO DO LIST especially since I'm guilty of making these infamous lists myself.  I loved the family aspect of this story and the way it makes you see that there are more important things in life than reaching every goal you set for yourself - there's health, family, love, and your own happiness.Chrissy Dionne (courtesy of Romance Junkies)","03 19, 2008",A2AY83K9N60V38,"C.

It was supposed to be a fun filled evening with friends at a masquerade party but instead she's fighting for her life and all of a sudden her life is irreversibly changed.  She certainly never suspected that her friends and Simon, the man she loves, have the ability to shift into Pumas.  Sure she wants Simon but eating cat chow and using a litter box holds absolutely no appeal so what's a girl to do?Simon already suspected that Becky is his mate before the attack but he hadn't claimed her or even let on that he had any intentions toward her.  His mate's life being threatened brings out all his protective instincts and he certainly isn't about to listen to Becky's arguments against their mating.  It's a done deal as far as he's concerned.  Before he can satisfy his inner animal and mate Becky though he has to take care of her injuries and even then she argues with him.  It's when she tells him `bite me' that he sees the perfect opportunity to get exactly what he wants - to claim her.  There's no denying that they're mated after he's marked her as his!Livia's attack on Becky was completely unprovoked and makes absolutely no sense to her - all she knows is that Livia has suddenly sprouted claws and fangs and is intent on killing her.  It isn't until Becky's best friend Emma arrives that the pieces begin to fit together.  Livia's envious of Emma's status within the pride and believes that if she can acquire the Curana's ring then she'll be queen instead of Emma.  That's not how things work though and `Senora Psychopath' is in for a rude awakening because Max, Emma and Simon aren't about to let her get away with what she's done.  Livia's sentenced to life as an outcast and Simon carries Becky off as his new mate.  If Simon thinks he's simply going to claim her and they'll live happily ever after then he'd better think again.  Sure Becky loves him but she's stubbornly refusing to say the words, her change is taking longer than it should, and she's suddenly ailing and the doctor's diagnosis isn't fully explaining the odd symptoms.Dana Marie Bell writes this story with such humor and drama that I was quickly caught up in the romance between Becky and Simon and was unable to put this book down.  SWEET DREAMS is the second book in the HALLE PUMA series and flows beautifully from the first book WALLFLOWER.  Becky's feisty comments and loving nature really kept me chuckling and Simon seems to get a real kick out of her snappy comebacks.  I loved getting to know all of the characters in this story and they each quickly began to feel like treasured friends that I'll be happy to revisit many times in the future.I'll definitely be keeping an eye out for more Dana Marie Bell's books in the future.  This story was fun, whimsical and wholly satisfying.  I'd definitely recommend picking up the other books in the HALLE PUMA series as well.  WALLFLOWER, SWEET DREAMS and CAT OF A DIFFERENT COLOR are all wonderful stories that truly capture the imagination.Chrissy Dionne (courtesy of Romance Junkies)","01 23, 2009",A2AY83K9N60V38,"C.

When she answered ad for an educated companion for a gentleman she soon discovered just what kind of companionship he was after, but because he was so lonely she continued to correspond with him and when he offered her 20 pounds to simply meet she couldn't refuse.  She soon realizes that the man is none other than her childhood hero badly wounded at war and in desperate need of comfort so she agrees to be his mistress for 2 months.I have to start out by saying the people who give his book 1 star for only being an e-book and 2 stars because it's an novella are doing it a disservice.  This is a very sweet tale and well worth reading.  The cover doesn't do it justice as it makes the book look like an erotica, there is only one love scene and it is nicely done.  Though the book could have been a bit longer I very much enjoyed Margaret as she tried to get Graham to open up and Graham as he fights her all the way.This is only about a 30 min to 1 hour read so the price might be a bit steep but I quite enjoyed it.4 1/2 stars.","03 24, 2012",A2V0H5HIN4OWKN,The book lady,Sweet and Touching,1332547200

He lives as a human and prefers it that way. Megan has embraced her ""otherness""; she is a werewolf and proud of it. When fate mates them, they need to find a way to deal with their differences, or live apart.Comments:- A reasonable length book (2650 kindle locations).- Preceding books followed a ""Werewolf Mafia"" story arc. It was wound up in ""Standoff"". ""Fated"" would standalone, the other books are not necessary for the enjoyment/understanding of this book. However, as characters from other books appear and play an integral role in ""Fated"", reading the books in sequence would be of benefit.- ""Fated"" begins 2 years after ""Standoff"".- Shane was Layla's anchor inReluctant. He has not appeared in other books. Megan is the last Warden sister of the Cascadia Wolves Pack to be mated and is Lex's Enforcer.- The earlier books in the series (other than ""Reluctant"") mixed the action/suspense of the Pellini arc with romance/wooing/angst of newly mated relationships. As the war no longer exists, ""Fated"" is all about the relationship. It is chock-full of emotion, angst, hope, heartbreak. And lots of sex. No violence, no shooting, no war.- Sex is m/f with a very HOT m/f/m encounter. Sex is all loving, generous.Opinion:Yes, I like this series of books. I think Dane brings originality as well as humour and love to the Shifter/paranormal genre. The sex is always HOT and the characters are always well-defined and interesting. The women are STRONG, physically, emotionally. They stand up for themselves and don't let anyone walk over them. The men (heroes) are Alpha, they want their women to be protected. But they always love and celebrate their strengths, differences and power. Shane, in ""Fated"", struggles with the differences, because he struggles with his own. But Megan knows who she is and what she wants and fights for it. Another fabulous book in the Cascadia series.","05 12, 2011",A1ZN2JLLR9GI3T,cathyr,A Shifter Romance with plenty of HOT sex and angst,1305158400

Kelly enjoys his life as a recluse and having Will around makes life better than Kelly expected.  However, Kelly has secrets from the world, and although Will shares them, Kelly is determined to keep them safely hidden.  As the author of the acclaimed Doorways, Kelly has managed to keep his identity hidden from the world, but when he writes a parody of Doorways called Windows on a dare from Will, it attracts all sorts of attention - attention that Kelly doesn't want.Jae-sun Fields is incensed that someone would dare write a parody of the beloved coming-of-age novel Doorways.  Working for the gossip rag The Adversary, Jae sets out to find and expose the awful woman, who is surely the culprit, of such desecration of his favorite novel.  However, as his investigation progresses he finds Kelly MacKay, who seems more than tangentially connected to his quest.  But what will Jae do with the information he finds?As Jae and Kelly continually meet, more than information is found.  Kelly is immensely attracted to Jae, but fears what such a connection might mean to his self-circumscribed isolation.  Jae wants to pursue Kelly for information, but also to satisfy his curiosity about the attraction between them.  Can both of these men make it work?ePistols at Dawn is a great emotional read that delves into the mysteries of the human mind and what it means to be gay in a not so accepting society.  Jae is a wonderfully funny character with his determination to find his nemesis and his ire at the desecration of his favorite book.  Kelly is so full of quirks that it is almost too much to deal with, but Z.A. Maxfield makes him a likeable character when she uses Will as a source of reality and mocking that slowly pushes Kelly to emerge from his shell.  As the story progresses it is sometimes hard to like Jae for his actions, but his ethics win in the end, making him a better man.  Kelly, on the other hand, is crippled by his OCD and fear of being found out as the author of such a revered work that he believes to be the product of such a self flagellation exercise.  Even as the relationship between Kelly and Jae is plagued by pot-holes in the road of love, their coming together in the end finds them both being better men for all their suffering.  As expected Z.A. Maxfield presents characters and situations that will pull you into the story and reading the book all in one sitting.

When he does uncover the secret he is shocked beyond belief, but beginning to understand his fascination with the Hunter while he observes the warrior talking with an enemy while evil stalks Evermyst.THE WARRIOR BRIDE may be the strongest of Lois Greiman's Scottish romances as the cast makes for quite an exciting tale.

A lot of us know how painful is any betrayal, especially a hit from those, who we love. The main character, Paul, was hearted by his wife's infidelity. This changed his life; he loses the reason of his life, trying to forget his pain with different women in different ways. Suddenly he meets ""the one"", but an accident renders him blind. Here's his real story begins.I admire people who have some serious diseases and stay alive, strong and shining. I admire people who believe in their life, despite any dramatic accidents or problems, who stay come and optimistic. You don't have to spare them, never, you should respect them instead.

Its super steamy and sexy and blew me away with the sex scenes. I think this  author really did a great job on writing this story. It was extremely creative, and who would have thought a game like that would bring them together. This book was super cute, In the beginning Charlie didn't realize how she felt about the men who have been in her life for many years, they scared away the men she brought home, interrogated them whenever she brought dates to dinner, and it just never occurred to her that they might all have feelings for her. one of the guys she has a strong connection to his name is Simon and he seems like he has always been in love with her. Her and Simon have the strongest connection compared to the other two men. Then there is Rafael and Eric, and they both have liked each other (the men) and they just never hooked up because they didn't want to ruin what they had with Charlie. Until this cruise happened, they never tried anything with each other, and when it finally happens and they take chances and risks, Charlie gets scared and runs away.

I find the age difference to be kind of sweet. I only felt that the beginning was a little hard to accept.Unless I'm mistaken about his duty time, I would have liked for Jack and Alex to have met as they did while Jack was not on duty. He really knew nothing about her and for him to get this intimate with her in this type of situation didn't seem like an honorable decision. She really could have turned out to be much younger than she had told him she was. It also didn't work because immediately after being assaulted by one man she just met, she got intimate with another man she just met. Some of their scenes take place in car but it was a little confusing exactly how they were positioned.

After a stint in the military they finally had the funds to make their dream a reality.  Their place is located in the Colorado mountains.  During snowstorms the route to town from their home is impossible.  Fortunately in lieu of a female during these times Bobby and Cale are more than compatible and have no qualms about helping each other out if and when the need arises.After catching her fianc&eacute; cheating on her again, Katherine Duvall makes the decision to escape the intolerable situation.  She leaves behind her engagement ring, grabs the rental car keys and drives off completely ignoring the bell staff's warning about driving without snow chains in the stormy weather - and that almost proved to be detrimental.Fortunately for Kate, Bobby and Cale are on their way home from town when they notice her vehicle and become concerned because it's obvious she isn't used to driving in snowy weather.  The men follow the other car for ten miles and just when they think she might make it and not slide off into the river it happens - her car fishtails and slides off the road into the freezing water.When it becomes obvious that Kate isn't thinking straight enough to save herself, Bobby goes into the water to rescue her.  It falls to Cale to get Bobby and the woman back to the truck and then to their home where he strips them all down and climbs into bed between them to use his own body heat to warm them up.  He just never anticipated they'd end up sharing so much more - though he certainly isn't complaining!Delilah Devlin's storylines never fail to pull readers into the story and SADDLED is no exception.  Bobby and Cale have very different personalities and expectations so it's extremely interesting how they respond both individually and together toward Kate.  Kate displays a vulnerability and honesty that really drew me to her.

9245,6104,B002I1XQ0A,"[1, 1]",5,"Where to start?  I wish I had read TIDAL WAVE sooner.  I loved Alexia and Joshua.  In fact, I believe that, after the ""dream"" scene betwixt the two, the childhood memory is one of my favorite parts.  It's so cute and innocent, and I think Vivan really captured how a young boy would act when being teased by the older boys in his family.  And then Alexia's innocence during the entire interaction... It made me smile.My all time favorite part of this book definitely had to be the scene when the two sleep together for the first time.  It's so tender... so loving.  I really got a sense of Joshua's love for Alexia, and I absolutely ADORED the fact that he would risk getting in trouble just to keep her safe.  Love love love!I wasn't entirely crazy about the dominance switch about halfway into the novel.  After Alexia rebukes Joshua for lying, it's like his character transforms from a dominating alpha into a little kitten with the alpha lurking under the surface... which is cute, but he simmers down in the bedroom a teensy bit.  And then Anthony, who was initially the little kitten, transforms into this dominating sex god.  Kind of weird, but hey, who doesn't love a guy who's confident in bed?  Plus, he did it for Alexia--since he knew she was too shy to start talking dirty--which makes him that more respectable in my eyes.Anthony had to grow on me, especially since I was shipping Alexia/Joshua from the start.  I'm not entirely a fan of threesomes in stories, however, this series--or more specifically, TIDAL WAVE--has made me a bit more open-minded about reading it.  But only by Vivian.  She doesn't make her sex scenes tacky.I loved the fact that, despite the story's length, there was plenty of room for character growth.  Alexia transformed from this shy, mortified creature into a true leader.  It was fun being able to witness that growth, and it was written eloquently.Just like all of her other stories, TIDAL WAVE ended on the perfect note.  I was absolutely satisfied with everything about it.  And Anthony kicked the bad guy's butt.  Woot!If you're like me and you don't read a lot of threesome stories, for whatever reason, TIDAL WAVE is the perfect introduction to this type of reading/writing.  Like I said, the sex isn't tacky, and you could tell that Alexia and Joshua really cared about each other (they were pretty much the ""main couple"" in my head, but you see the love with Anthony also, but I personally didn't find it as intense as Joshua's).

I think this one is even better!  The story was quite moving and I loved the way so many different kinds of trust issues were explored. I loved the main male characters, Jae, Kelly and Will, & the complexity with which each character was drawn:  Kelly struggling with all his fears and uncertainty who at the same time was a very brave and loving man, Jae struggling with his conscience over issues of personal honesty and changing feelings about his line of work, and Will, struggling to recover from a past that has left him emotionally damaged and to learn to let go of the safe haven he's found with Kelly.  Also LOVE the physical descriptions of the characters, particularly Jae! A 6'5"" gorgeous Asian man ""built like a tree trunk"" with a braid of long dark hair as thick as a man's wrist that hangs to his @ss - Oooh La La!!!  (I notice the writer seems to have, like me, a bit of a ""thing"" about hot Asian guys with long hair in a braid, as there was a character like this in ""Drawn Together"" too - Love It!)","03 9, 2013",A2OV04XU42UWTX,PJ,LOVED THIS VERY MOVING STORY,1362787200

10967,3899,B00264H2VI,"[5, 6]",5,"Plot/Storyline: 5 StarsWhen I was a kid, I had a book called ""One Minute Mysteries"" that I loved. It had short mysteries that had clues in them. At the end of each one, the detective would state that he had solved the crime, then the book would ask something like, ""How did he know?"" The reader could try to figure it out, then turn the page for the answer. There are four stories in this format included in this collection. I have to admit that I was only able to 'solve' two of them.  This author showed tremendous talent in his ability to weave intelligent mysteries.Being a fan of his Jack Daniels mysteries, I especially enjoyed the stories featuring her, her partner, and Phineas Trout. However, you do not have to have read any of those books to enjoy the stories.There is also a `horror' section with some truly gruesome tales. The themes in this part include vampires, zombies, aliens, abortion, ghosts, etc. This collection is not for the weak-stomached or the easily offended.The `humor' section at the end has a few essays/stories that are aimed more at authors, but they were still very funny.  I also loved the one about James Bond's toys. There was another one that still has me wondering how you can kill someone with fabric softener.Every single story in this collection has an original and interesting plot. The humor injected into even the most disturbing scenario made for enjoyable reads throughout.Character Development: 5 StarsThe characters in each of these tales were developed to the extent necessary for the reader's enjoyment. There weren't any actual character study types as these were mainly plot and story driven works.Writing Style: 5 StarsThe writing style was exactly what I have come to expect from Mr. Konrath. Not only is his prose concise and well-structured, but he has truly mastered the art of the short story.Editing/Formatting: 4 3/4 StarsThe editing and formatting were of mostly professional quality.Rating: NC-17 for Graphic Violence, Rape, Necrophilia, Pedophilia, and any other `ilia' you can probably think of. In other words, this is a VERY graphic collection.","10 19, 2009",A22Z3RZ040GL35,Lynn McNamee,Proof of Brilliance,1255910400

11481,1085,B0010ZGPB2,"[1, 1]",5,"From [...]I have never before read a book like Steve Peek's Long Claws.It is a thriller and a horror story. The tale unfolds with so much mystery, sections of the story delivered one chunk at a time, that you're held captive to its pages simply out of a desire to find out why something happened in a previous chapter. It's one of those books that keeps you saying, ""Okay, just one more page and then I'll mow the lawn."" And you keep saying it over and over until you're at the last page, not knowing how you got there so quickly.Mr. Peek tells the story from many perspectives, jumping around from character to character, revealing the bigger picture in stages. Normally, for me, this is a writing style that puts me off; I like to bond with my main character, and I don't like it when the narrative runs off to follow someone else. But with Long Claws, although there is a main character, the other characters that are touched upon are just as unique and interesting. With each turn of the tale, I was surprised to feel a little disappointed that I had to take leave of the character I'd just been following - that's a good thing. It means I was fully invested in each and every one of them, a strong testament to the author's skill.And here is the most amazing part: some of the characters followed are insects, some are werewolves (sort of), some are regular people, and others are people with special powers of awareness. Yes - insects. Steve Peek takes you into the minds and inner workings of a species of insects he's created. And he does it well.This story is epic. The majority of it spans the course of a fifty(ish) year period, but its roots go back tens of thousands of years. Modern mysteries and legends are woven into the fabric of new legends that are the foundation of this story.This isn't a story that begins with a bang. Do not put it down if you are not hooked by the first five pages. You will not be disappointed if you continue the story to its conclusion.","07 13, 2013",A3IT3XAOJKN59B,Matthew Keith,A Must-Read for Horror Fans - A Truly Original Story!,1373673600

It did feel like a grudge match there for a bit but the reasons are again clear. I think she reacted realisticly when put on the defensive. How do you go from having everything you ever wanted to letting it go without a fight. For Brian he had noticed her before but he had not grasped the fact that Amber had him on such a pedestal. It was a stroke of luck that they met again and while he was not happy with how things were moving along he was not going to just walk away from it no matter what it cost his sense of right and wrong.

In fact, the author drew all the threads together in a smooth, professional manner that impressed me.Toward the end, I admit to thinking *now* what's going to happen?

She has never really been comfortable with her life and is completely obsessed with the pirate she's about to put on display. That pirate is James Morrow, who did a lot of his pirating in the early 1700's. Becca was so obsessed with the age and the pirate she even learned how to fence. So, as she's putting the display up, she decides to test a sword that came with all the other items, thus taking her back in time to Captain Morrow's ship. I didn't realize when I purchased Treasured that it was sort of a Time Travel novella. I may not have purchased it had I known, but I am quite happy I did buy and read it!Apparently Becca could basically have been twins with James's wife Rebecca. No one on board liked the original wife and quite frankly she despised them all. Becca, however, fits in better than she ever did in what she had known as her time. It is very amusing how James doesn't understand the sudden changes in his wife. She never liked having sex with him, and didn't like him at all.

Emily Taylor is his efficient, smart, mousy, oh-so-uptight personal assistant.They have the perfect working relationship. Jake depends on Emily for everything, and Emily pretends to respect him. But then the unthinkable happens. Emily decides to branch out into the world of dating (as only the efficient, practical, and pragmatic would ever dream of doing) and somehow, Jake notices Emily is actually a woman. Not only does he notice, but it appears that every guy around has taken notice as well and Jake decides that he has to save Emily from herself and all the horny men of New York, who are all too willing to take advantage of his naive assistant.When Ms Marton gets it right, there is no Harlequin author better. How she is able to make these two characters (with their personalities) believable and engaging is beyond me. That she also manages to make them relatable and likable is a feat worthy of praise.

She is the type of person you really want to hate.  You don&#8217;t hear much about the father until later on. This story, although fantasy has so much to teach us.  When Brian finds the amulet he kind of lets the power go to his head.  I have been a fan of the TV show &#8220;Once Upon A Time&#8221;.  Mr. Gold aka Rumplestiltskin has a saying every time someone comes to him for magic.  He reminds them that they need to remember that &#8220;magic comes with a price&#8221;.  It seems that Brian never thought about the price of using the amulet until it was almost too late.  What I didn&#8217;t understand was why his mom waited so long to let him know she knew he had it.  It added another layer of hardness and uncaring to her character.  This story has a redemptive side.  This is an allegorical novel.  It can be read by young and old, Christian and Non-Christian and be enjoyed by all.  I read this as an e-book.  This is a book I most definitely want to get for my classroom.

She needed to find another position, and it was the only way to make it to the job conference.  What follows next is a near death experience that changes her life forever when a gorgeous vineyard owner rescues her.Atticus Maxwell is a vampire enforcer who's lived for centuries, yearning and hoping for the One to bring meaning to his life.  Meeting Lissa knocks him out of his ennui once he's awakened to an all encompassing love.  Could she be the One he's searched for?  Once it's learned that the accident was no accident, Atticus does everything in his power to ensure that Lissa stays alive long enough for them to explore all the possibilities.Most of the vampire novels I tend to steer towards are usually dark, violent, brutal and brimming with lurid sex (think JR Ward), which makes them not quite as emotionally romantic as One and Only.  This delightfully sweet paranormal romance carried an ""R in Romantic"" timeless vibe.  Sure the sex is sensual, at times even naughty, but the amiable warmth here is old school.  It's not in the bodice ripper class; there's definitely violin and piano music serenading reader heartstrings.Atticus is noble and honorable with that air of Byronic tragedy that makes him vulnerable without being a stuffy wimp.  When he opens his heart and life to the equally lonely and engaging Lissa, I was so glad they finally found one another.  There's a tender thread throughout that works well with themes of friendship, loyalty, and hope, as well as the continuing battle of good vs. evil.  All in all, I was left with a pleasant feeling, which means I'd like to see where this series goes.

You will cringe from the emotions invoked by this thriller.  You might even become a little paranoid yourself.The protagonist, Argus, of this book already knows that he has a problem. However, he also knows that his medication controls it. So, what happens when he sees a naked stewardess serving drinks on a plane and none of the other passengers notice?  Well, he must be going crazy again, right?There are many plot twists and turns while Argus goes on a journey to try to figure out what is real and what is not. He also needs to clear himself of a murder charge. This is a bit difficult to do while in a mental institution.Reading this book will have you on the edge of your seat, unable to put it down. I was actually sad to see it end.Character Development: 4 3/4 StarsArgus is a very logical character. Although he suffers from a mental illness, readers can easily put themselves in his shoes to understand the realistic decisions made by him.I did wonder at times why he didn't spare a little more thought to his wife and child.Writing Style: 5 StarsThis book is extremely well written with tight, concise prose. Every single sentence forwards the plot and story line.Editing/Formatting: 5 StarsThis is a self-published work without an error to be found. It is of better quality than many commercially published books. The Kindle formatting is also excellent.Rating: PG-13 due to minimal violence and mature psychological issues","07 30, 2009",A22Z3RZ040GL35,Lynn McNamee,Couldn't Put It Down,1248912000

I really enjoyed the first book where we also met Dante and Duncan for the first time.  Dante is the ultimate sexy good guy.  Megan is a part werewolf trying to ""work off"" an old family blood debt to clear her family's name and bring honor back to them, but got tricked in to giving her allegiance to the wrong people.  They in turn force her to do many questionable things.  Her supposed final task is to spy on Dante and find out what happened to a dark mage (enemy from the 1st book) and report back.  She and Dante fall in love and he and his good friend Duncan basically have to help undo the spells and compulsions that were put on her by the enemies, in order for them to move forward in their new relationship.  They also have to continue fighting against some ancient dark enemies that are striving to return to this world and take over.  All this while trying to figure out how the dynamics of their relationship will work, as in the past it's been forbidden...a Vampire mating with someone of ""her"" origins (can't spoil it by saying what they discover she is!!).  That's just a basic overview.  Lots of discoveries and fun details....read it~~I really appreciate when an author can bring two people together in a story early on and work out their ""secrets"" and ""misunderstandings"" right off the bat so they can continue as a team and fight the bad guys.  It saves so much angst in the whole process.  Readers don't always like to read the whole story of two peoples' suffering so they can get together in the last 5 pages of the book.

Miranda's a little like the wife in the movie True Lies, she lives simply to take care of her husband the lightkeeper, and her two boys.  But she loves deeply, and she takes action when her husband disappears. She is naive and finds herself in a foreign world with the only resource of herself to rely upon.  She stumbles around not knowing what a morass she has placed herself into. Nothing is at it seems. She can't tell the good guys from the bad guys. This character development and plot is a study of subtlety. There is enough suspense and mystery to intrigue the reader to stick with Miranda. I love Miranda. I love devoted mothers and wives.  I really love that this author made the power of love be the guiding motivation for our heroine.  This is not an action genre book.  Which makes it all the more delicious.  This is a real life fantasy, sci-fi, magic story that you can't quite pin anywhere.  The writing is superb.  The reviewers who didn't like this book are probably needing 'in your face' stimulation that is fast and dramatic. This is a book to be savored and tasted. It's like engaging in high tea with Devon cream and croissants. You soak in the ambiance, smell the salt air, skirt the garbage and stay alert to being followed.  This is the most courageous of heroines because she diligently continues her search with her inadequate knowledge. She pieces together the mystery of her husband. She continues on in the face of complete unknowing - which is one of the greatest challenges we each face in our own world. She continues on even when everything she knows turns upside down. This book is a bestseller for a reason.  It is an amazing book.

Not that he is confused, I think that's how they related to things in that period.It still amazes me, and angers me, as a Belgian, how Germany managed to survive as a nation.  To call them brutes or barbarians and murderers is not enough.  What they perpetrated on Europe in two world wars is beyond comprehension.  After viewing the wanton, unnecessary, almost childish destruction caused by the retreating Germans, the author actually hopes that one German city will be levelled entirely, as punishment, retribution, and as a lesson to future Germans that wars of expansion in Europe are unwanted and will be avenged.  This did not happen.Author tours the French and British trenches and rear areas, giving amazing insight into the French military psyche at the time.  That part, I enjoyed the most.

However, I am quickly finding they can be quite good and my opinion has changed.  I love the Cattle Valley series by Carol Lynne, so when I saw this novella from TA Chase (who I have read and enjoyed before) I went for it.The story is a fairly straightforward romance.  Tyler and JT are twins, and Tyler has always been the follower, taking care of JT on the rodeo circuit.  Until he finally decides he needs a life of his own, possibly with the handsome horse breeder Ren, that he can't get out of his heart.  There is angst in the story (JT having slept with said horse breeder simply b/c Tyler wanted him!) but it is nothing heartrending and easily overcome by the couple - as it should be in a novella that doesn't have the time or scope to expand.  The sex (I know you romance junkies are wondering) was excellent, better than I find in most short stories/novellas.  Chase throws a bit of kink into the mix, so it's not vanilla, but it is also far from BDSM.  A little bondage and some spanking heat the sex up very satisfyingly without tipping into uncomfortable.  I could easily reread this story again.A couple things did annoy me, such as Tyler constantly referring to Ren as ""the older man"" and the somewhat abrupt ending.  There was the requisite HEA, but a couple more paragraphs would have ended it more smoothly. Overall though, it was a very good story and I actually hope there'll be a sequel with JT.","07 29, 2009",ACEA95FQS1AVP,Jem,"A good, satisfying cowboy romance",1248825600

That is the only question to ask yourself. If you find your curiosity piqued or you KNOW you would, then read this. If not, then move on to something else.Reading order in the series:Rachel's TotemIn Plain SightFoxy LadyCHARACTERS: All these characters are sweet and sexy. It's a quirky little town with quirky people. This is a FAST read, so not a lot of development. I was actually surprised at how well the entire town was depicted in such a short book. While no one was fully developed, I got a good sense of the character of the place.PLOT: Again, this is a novella in a genre known for keeping things simple. Not a big plot line here- but for what it is, it's well done. It is definitely more creative than most I've read and opens up a world of possibilities for future books. All told, brilliant execution through simplicity.BOTTOM LINE: Recommended if you are up for some erotically messy f/m/m/m- no BSDM or m/m. This book is what it is and either you'll have fun with it or you won't.RECOMMENDATIONS: (some of these are more erotic than others...)1. Vivian Arend'sWolf Signs: Granite Lake Wolves, Book 1fun, light were-romance series (lower on the erotic scale)2. Vivian Arend'sTidal Wave: Forces of Nature, Book 1- a light, lusty read with frolicking dolphins3. R.G.

1679,5311,B002F3PPVE,"[0, 0]",5,"My Soul to Lose is a novella set in the world of author Rachel Vincent's Soul Screamers series prior to the events that take place in the first full-length book in the series, My Soul to Take.Told from the perspective of the main character in the series, Kaylee Cavanaugh, it gives readers a short glimpse into her life prior to her discovery of who and what she is. In this story both readers and Kaylee are unaware of just what is wrong with her and why she has debilitating ""panic attacks"" that cause her to scream uncontrollably, to see things that shouldn't be there, and that leave her hoarse, terrified and questioning her sanity.And while the novella creates more questions than provides answers, it does introduce readers to Kaylee and gives them a look at a heroine who is in many ways a normal, frightened teenage girl who just wishes none of this was happening to her, but who is also strong and selfless and who manages to retain her sarcasm and sense of humor through it all.My Soul to Lose is an exciting and immensely entertaining introduction to this series. It develops the main character and teases the world enough for readers to want to know more. It gives readers a feel for the author's writing style and gives them a peek at several characters who will make an appearance in later books in the series.Whether the novella is read prior to having read any or all of the full-length books in the series or not, it will be captivating and intriguing, humorous and heartbreaking, a little bit shocking and most definitely eye-opening.While My Soul to Lose can be read at any point during the series, reading it prior to the first book offers a very different experience for readers than reading it at any point thereafter. But for new readers and fans of the series alike, this novella is an absolute must read.","06 14, 2012",A1ZHEK7NJJWKE9,Fiktshun,An immensely entertaining introduction to this series,1339632000

The question, of course, is why, and it is this question that underlies her journey to Vastorn.  Along the way, a group of feyquin (similar to horses) stop her in an effort to prevent her from going to the king.The best part of this book is that the author kept me guessing as to why she shouldn't go to Vastorn and who doesn't want her to get there.  There was another surprise that popped up that I didn't forsee, but I don't want to ruin the surprise.  Overall, the book chronicles her journey to Vastorn (because she's determined to get there, no matter what).  But the question is really, should she go or not?  It was a fun read, especially the parts about the feyquin and the unexpected friendship that she develops with them.  I also enjoyed the night mares who proved that not all is what it seems.

But I realized that the relatively slow pace of time through the book meant that the author was planning quite a long epic story. And I love epic fantasy books. So I enjoyed that this first book just barely started the story.  We lived through the childhood years in which Jahrra behaves rather like a typical child with all the immature decision making that goes along with it. However we begin to see the bigger picture little by little through the stories she's told. And we see signs of the person she's going to grow up to be. So many books these days try to cram far too much into a single book. I really like the fact that it's going to take a few of them to tell the whole story.  It's true that there isn't a whole lot of action in this book but there was plenty for me.

Her books specialize in Regency period England, M/M erotic romances.  And they are all filled with scorching hot erotic scenes between well drawn, flawed yet generally sympathetic characters who one hopes will find a way to a permanent loving relationship.  The fact that this (as do all her books) takes place in an era when anal sex could get guys hanged (literally) for sodomy added an extra challenge to a plot involving two men seeking more than just companionship.Her books all involve some strong tension / conflict between the protagonists, and this one is no exception.  Arsen is rich, powerful, sexually adept, socially prominent yet a ""bad boy"" and ""known"" womanizer, but he is not satisfied with any of his previous mistresses and not in search of a virginal young woman / debutante to marry.  Harry is a big, gorgeous, raw-boned hunk, with only minimal sexual experience, who has the ""misfortune"" to have fallen head over heels in love with straight, womanizer Arsen, usually a recipe for disaster if ever there was one.  So the two have some dancing around each other to do before either reveals his true feelings, then those initial revelations are incomplete, leading to some misconceptions and wrong ""conclusions.""  Not necessarily the most creative plotline, but lots of tension and uncertainty, great characters who are flawed but sympathetic, and enjoyable escapist literature.

When Arsen invites him to a house party, Henry agrees, even though he knows being around the object of his desire will be torture.  Was the invitation merely an act of friendship, or much more?Object of His Desire is a quick, hot Regency tale.  Large, almost shy Henry's devotion to Arsen is sweet.  Arsen is aristocratic and at times comes off as almost cold, but when his inner feelings peek out he's a worthy hero.  I enjoyed watching Henry and Arsen fumble from sex to something more, and reading about Henry's frightening past added depth to the story.  While Object of His Desire could have benefited, in my mind, from having more background and more on how Henry and Arsen's relationship turned out, it was an entertaining and hot read.  If you like Regencies and gay romance, as I do, Object of His Desire is definitely a story to pick up.CassieReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed","11 23, 2009",A320TMDV6KCFU,MNix,Object of His Desire,1258934400

What I will tell you is that I absolutely LOVED this book. It's rare to find an author who can write as poignantly as Megan Hart, what's even rarer is finding an author who can write short stories that are just as deep, touching, and moving. This story was more than I imagined it to be. I thought, ""A short story about Elle and Dan! Yay!"" I read the blurb and expected Elle to be at war with her feelings regarding a baby (which she was). What I didn't expect was so much to be packed into so few words. It was about Elle but we also got to see so many other people in her life and what they mean to her and how they help her form her decision as to whether or not she's ready to have a baby. In the end, the decision she makes comes from her heart. I love how well Dan fits her. He just lets her make her own decisions. He may plant the seed of thought there, but he doesn't push. THAT is what makes them perfect together.I love follow-up stories like this. Thank goodness for Spice Briefs because otherwise we may not have had another chance to visit with Dan and Elle. I can't help but wonder if Ms. Hart will, at some time in the future, let us drop in on Elle and Dan and see what's new in their lives once again. I know they've got their happily-ever-after and that alone can sustain me, but I like Elle and her complexity. She's real.

5406,3169,B001UE7D0K,"[5, 5]",5,"This book could easily carry another subtitle: How to Train Your Brain! According to the author there's a simple way to do that: Mind Mapping.If someone ever told me that there was a way for me to start reading faster than I already do, I'd say that he was crazy. And if I'd never read this book I'd insist he was. However in the book at hand I've discovered a simple example, which I'll call for the purposes of this review 'Reading by the Dot,' that left me speechless. Thanks to it I did not only read a paragraph in great speed, but I've also memorized almost every word of it.It is widely known that every person uses only a limited amount of his mind's capabilities. This book offers the reader a chance to enhance his reading and learning experiences, and improve his memory as well.As we read in the introduction: ""A Mind Map is a diagram you create to organize your thoughts. In conventional note-taking, you write information down line by line or perhaps column by column. Mind Mapping differs from such note-taking in that you present the information more in the form of a diagram.""And how does that help me? one would ask. Well, for starters, I'd answer, it helps with your memory since it is easier to remember images than words. Visualization is the key word here. Kids, just as much as the adults, do not have many difficulties in remembering images but when it comes to words it's a different story.One of the examples that the author uses to prove his point is the diagrams he uses to create an overview of the popular novel To Kill a Mockingbird. Through these diagrams we follow the book from point one all the way to the end, taking a good look at the characters and their interactions, and thus get a brief yet detailed view of the story. ""One idea is interconnected with many other ideas,"" we read, and, as we well know, one person is interconnected with many other persons, which helps prove the point.Mind Mapping has many advantages; it balances the brain, simplifies life, helps with creativity, and speeds up the learning processes. It also has some disadvantages though since it asks of you to change your habits, to spend time to get to know how it works, and maybe creates some minor problems when it comes to speaking since language is an auditory process. The former though overrule the latter, since learning how to operate with Mind Maps can help you change your life for the better in many ways.""...essentially, there's no limit to how vast your Mind Map can become. A subtopic in the first Mind Map you create may become the central idea in the next one you draw. Each subtopic in a map is in effect a center of another map. This is the beauty of the technique--relationships may go on as extensively as they exist in your mind."" Now, how interesting is that!To be honest before reading this book I knew next to nothing about how Mind Mapping works. I've read things about it here and there, but I'd never thought to give it a try. Well, all that has changed. I now find this subject as intriguing as they come. As someone who reads dozens of books every year, and always wishes to read even more, I believe that adopting the technique of Mind Mapping will help me achieve my goals. I think that if I should come to master it the results could be, if nothing else, highly satisfying.Mind Mapping can help one in many walks of life: from organizing vacations to creating business plans, from generating presentations to solving everyday problems, and the list goes on and on.A lot of people say that everything is in our head; the book at hand proves them right. And then it highlights the way one has to follow to reach his own high point, to widen his horizons.If you'd ask me to put this book in a category I wouldn't know which one to choose.

I like that it isn't too big and that it fits inside my not-too-big purse due to the fact that there's no extra space, yet it protects the Kindle very well, just like a glove.

That also means it doesn't slide against the material in the inside of the case very easily.

I expect to feel disgust, anger and sadness when reading accounts of the Holocaust-what I didn't expect was how this book made me examine myself, and analyze what I believe in my heart...I am struggling to put into words what I am feeling, but I will try...Sol makes the point when talking to the priest that Christians have been taught from birth that the only way is through Christ, and they are all anti-Semitic, even if sub-consciously... I consider myself a Christian, but was not raised in any particular ""religion""- as a result, I only have the Bible to go on, where it is repeatedly said that the Jews are Gods Chosen people... I can't imagine that has changed. God is not fickle. Is God going to refuse the Jewish people, who also love and serve Him? If I thought that were possible than maybe He isn't a God I want to serve...As long as anyone is condemning someone else for having a different belief system than their own, we are doomed to repeat history. There are many paths to God. It makes me cringe when any one religion claims theirs' is the ONLY way. We need to embrace each other, as equal children of God, and remember that the Greatest Commandment is LOVE. Who are we to judge another?I highly recommend this book.

Sardonic, embittered, suspicious, but at heart a gentleman and an honorable ex-soldier, he expects the worst from everyone and brings out the best in many.Tuttle's world is very reminiscent of Terry Pratchett's Ankh-Morpork. Very reminiscent - to the point where it bothered me quite a bit. Not only is there the same mix of fantasy and urban reality, you have Trolls playing a very large part in the story - and they're identical to Pratchett's trolls. Even the opening reminds one of the start of 'Guards, Guards'. The character names are very similar, as are the details of shops and the city and the river. Not identical, mind you, just a bit too close an imitation at times. As 'Dead Man's Rain, progresses, however, it finds its own unique voice and setting, and I stopped thinking this was Pratchett noir.'Dead Man's Rain' is a horror story and a narrative about venal instincts, greed and guilt. The set up is a little Maltese Falconish, and Markhat's weary cynicism is pure Spade as he deals with the snobby Widow Merlat and a incredible tales of ghosts and hauntings. But then, just as Tuttle sets you up thinking the plot will be resolved one way, he takes you down another. We learn more about Merlat's family, and her, and her servants, and Markhat reveals the qualities that kept him alive through a bitter and destructive war, in order to save the good and punish the wicked. This is not a romance - there's no pairing in this at all - and that's how it should be for our tarnished hero.Tuttle's writing is delightful, and even if he's borrowed some settings a little too heavily, Markhat's his own memorable creation, as are the plots and the dialogue. He's funny, in a very Bogartian sort of way, but like Pratchett, there's a deeper thread to his narrative than simple humour, with many a wry observation on human and non-human behaviour, populating his stories with vivid characters who continually surprise the reader.Really, there's nothing not to like here, if you like this genre, and aren't put off by the lack of romance. Finder Markhat is someone I want to read more about, and I hope Mr Tuttle revisits him.","06 16, 2009",A31LB0DBMZJT72,"Ann Somerville ""Love, romance, and the occasi...","Unusual, gripping, a damn good read",1245110400

The ""Smart"" zombies kept their thoughts and personality from before they were changed, grew smarter, could talk and became stronger the more they fed, and the ""shamblers"" were just your traditional stupid, non talking ""brainnnnnns"" type. Even though i am a die hard ""brainnnnns"" fan, I liked the new smart zombies. I liked how it showed the story from the zombies point of view. It was more of ""evolution"" than a ""invasion"" of zombies. Its about time zombies became as smart as vampires and take their place as something that could form its own society to feed off the weaker humans. Its soooo nice to see them as something other than a monster to just fear and bash their heads in. I can see great possibilities for the story to grow out to a new world order type thing where the zombies become the dominate species and humans battle for a spot to live and not be food.The typos and mis-labeled/named characters were distracting and confusing. There is a part where Nancy is slapping Jimbo and it says Fred. I had to read that section several times to understand it. And then there is a chapter that ends with just the end half a sentence hanging. It makes you wonder what you missed.Over all for the price I paid to read the story, it was totally worth it. I am intrigued and off to buy the others by Mark Clodi. I totally recommend it as a read, just take the errors with a smile, no one is perfect.","02 17, 2010",AJY9BZ20C9UU4,Amazon Customer,Not your average zombie story,1266364800

Fortunately, she's not a weepy, woe-is-me kind of girl.  It's obvious that she's scared and just when it seems that her situation can't be much worse, she becomes the focus of a disagreement amongst the gang.Cal Riker was horrified when he saw Norton pull the beautiful woman from the train.  He may be running with the gang of outlaws but he isn't truly one of them.  Rather than let them take turns raping her, Cal offers his share of the profits in exchange for her.  If there's any hope of his saving her from their lecherous intents then he'll have to make them believe he wants her all to himself.Laurel's shocked to learn that Cal is the legendary killer she's heard so much about but his actions aren't what she'd expect of a ruthless man.  It would have been simple for him to take advantage of her but instead he protects her and insists that he'll deliver her safely to her family.Laurel quickly realizes that she's extremely attracted to Cal and for the first time in her life she's willing to put her heart on the line. Cal tries to play a tough-as-nails outlaw but there's a softer side to him.  They spend a lot of time alone together after leaving the gang and neither of them regrets it when they become lovers.  Cal assumes that their time together will come to an end when she returns home.  Laurel has other ideas.  She's determined to make a life with him and with her family's influence she's sure that it's a possibility.  Is there any hope that he can escape his past and become the model citizen she's sure he can be?Emma Wildes tells awesome historical tales and this story is a prime example of why she's an author on my auto buy list.  LAWLESS is full of all the historical wonders, emotional angst and sexual tension I've come to appreciate in my reading material.  Laurel is a spunky character who's found herself in a difficult situation that would have reduced most women to tearful begging.  Cal is an honorable man who does what he believes is right - and it's cost him the sort of life that he should have lived.  This is a wonderful tale that leaves you with a smile in your heart which in my opinion is always the best sort of story.Chrissy Dionne (courtesy of Romance Junkies)","07 7, 2008",A2AY83K9N60V38,"C.

""Babylonian Laws,"" which most of us were (I am not sure if this is still the case) exposed to in Junior High, or at the very latest, in High School, are of course more popularly known as ""The Code of Hammurabi"" and are the oldest known (I stress ""known"") laws we presently have access to.This copy, which was published in or around 1903 by C.H.W. Johns (1857 - 1920) contains all the know elements of this code.  Some of the material here is rather fragmented and much has been lost down through the ages.  After all, this work was created around B.C. 2285 - 2242.In this particular work we are given a very nice forward by C.H.W. Johns who was an Assyriologist and Church of England Clergyman.  Johns has quite a number of academic papers under his belt, this being one of them.After the introduction the actual code, or what we know if it, is recorded in all of its known sections.  I personally found this to be an interesting read.  I must admit to having never read the Code in its entirety before and this gave me a golden opportunity to do so.The reader will find that almost all aspects of society at that time were covered.  Quite a number of the situations found during those times no longer exists, but on the other hand many do and for me it is interesting to note that mankind has not changed all that much down through the ages.It is of particular note the various punishments required for infractions of many of these laws.  I covered the first 15 or so pages and I fear to tell you that had I lived at that time my life would have been rather short due to the fact that the death penalty seemed to be the main form of punishment...with drowning and burning being at the top of the list as to methodology.These laws, while quite primitive in our eyes, covered trade, marriage,  slave ownership, concubine management, farming, trade, social interaction and on and on.This is not a good forum to discuss all of these laws item by item as a large number of volumes have been published down through the years addressing this code and most have easy access to these works - if of course, there is interest.For those that are familiar with our current laws (those that possess a far greater understanding than I care to have) will be fascinated as to how this Code has influenced the laws of various societies down through the years.This, as I said, is a free down load and it is a most worthwhile download.  This is a part of our history ergo, we all need to be at least somewhat familiar with it.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks","03 23, 2012",A1MC6BFHWY6WC3,D.

I read the sample and immediately one-clicked the rest. I found his story setting, details, characters to all be well-written, highly detailed in the places where details counted and easily understood.

317,1587,B001892DIO,"[1, 1]",5,"One thing you could say of T.A. Chase's books is that they are all very different. This one is a sexual romp (from Merriam Webster Online romp = a: high-spirited, carefree, and boisterous play b: something suggestive of such play: as (1): a light fast-paced narrative, dramatic, or musical work usually in a comic mood (2): an episode of lovemaking).Kasey is a 23 years old pro basketball player. He is only in his second year as professional player and he has no courage to openly admit that he is gay. He is out with his family and friends, but not with the public opinion. Plus his twin brother Garrett, a famous actor, has made coming out some years ago and now all media are only waiting for him to make the same claim.But Kasey till now has never had a boyfriend to care and he doesn't see the reason to suffer all the harrassment he will receive in the locker room if he makes that claim. That is, but now in Kasey's life enters Gram, a night club owner and an openly gay man who had bad experiences in the past with closeted lovers.Kasey must decide if he is willing to risk his career to keep his lover by his side.The story is not very long, less than 90 pages, but it's very erotic. From the first time Kasey and Gram have a very intense relationship and they are driven by lust most of the time. Since Kasey is a 23 years old guy that for sometime was deprived of a sexual partner, I think it's not strange that now that he can have someone near him, he is in frenzy to make up for the lost time. Plus it was a true discovery that Kasey is a totally bottom. I'm used to sports characters to be always very manly, even if gay, and usually they are totally top. Instead Kasey wants to be mastered, even if he is a pushy bottom.The main characters don't interact a lot with the supporting characters, but there are some interesting figures: Garrett, Kasey's brother, Paul, Kasey's teammate, but also Bo, Gram's employee and Colville, another pro basketball player. Since this is the first book in a series, I think we will have the chance to read something on one or plus of these characters.","04 25, 2008",A1E481YU3ZPK6S,Elisa,Out of Bounds (Love of Sports 1) by T.A.

Beam Piper didn't invent the parallel universes concept, but he did more than almost anyone else to popularize it.Piper's Paratime is an infinite band of parallel Earths, each splitting off as the result of a decision somewhere in history. The resulting levels range from uninhabited Earths to Earths with high space-faring civilizations. And one of those Earths discovered how to travel between these worlds.Of course a paratime traveling civilization opens the possibility of all sorts of mischief and requires a police force. Since the Original Time Line has exhausted its resources, it needs paratime travel to obtain the resources it requires to continue to exist. It's the job of the Paratime Police to keep order among the paratimers and to keep the Paratime Secret at all costs.These stories are built around the career of Verkan Val, paratime policeman extraordinary, and his efforts to help his culture keep the Paratime Secret. It's not an easy job. In the course of these stories Val has to recover a Venusian Night Hound that has been let loose on our timeline (late-40's Pennsylvania to be exact), get his sometime-wife Dalla off a world where reincarnation is scientifically proven fact before she overturns the entire civilization, and battle a gang of trans time slavers whose roots reach into the very heart of the Original Time Line government itself.Most of these stories originally appeared in Astounding Science Fiction in the late 40s and 50s. Like most Astounding offerings, they're full of high action against well-thought-out backgrounds and spiced with interesting characters. It makes for a colorful offering.Although Piper had been writing science fiction for more than 15 years, he didn't attract real notice until his last Paratime story, Lord Kalvin of Otherwhen, and the unrelated Little Fuzzy. Unfortunately, depressed by financial troubles, he committed suicide just as his career was taking off. It's good to have this collection to help remember H. Beam Piper at his best.","12 9, 2012",A3GYONLFL47Y9M,Rick Cook,All good reads in the fine old tradition,1355011200
10540,6096,B002I1XQ00,"[3, 3]",5,"Pete Toleffson is in Konigsburg, Texas because his brother Cal has finally convinced his fiance Docia to have a wedding ceremony. He's Cal's best man, but he has no idea what a best man is supposed to do, exactly. He's pretty sure he's not supposed to punch his brother, but the impulse is there every time he catches sight of Calthorpe's ever-present and perpetually satisfied grin. It's not that Pete begrudges his brother's happiness, but Pete's in a strange town full of stranger people and ragged from his job as a county attorney - a job that he tends to obsess over...to the point that he can't remember the last time he took a vacation. Staying away from his email and voicemail while he's in Konigsburg takes conscious intensive effort, and he could buy stock in the antacid company that keeps his acid reflux in check. Supporting his brother through The Wedding from hell might just be his undoing.If sheer force of will and hard work can make The Wedding go as planned, Janie Dupree's life would be a lot less complicated. Unfortunately, everything about The Wedding seems destined to a calamitous end despite all her efforts and the best man is absolutely no help. Not to mention, he's rude. Cute though. But Janie's seeing someone...sort of...even if he is boring and self-involved. And then there's The Wedding, which is taking every single ounce of self control and mental fortitude to deal with.Just when Pete is starting to relax, and starting to more than notice Janie and even step up a little in his best man role, Toleffsons start to pour into Konigsburg and it becomes painfully clear that the town is definitely not big enough for all of them. Neither Pete nor Janie would put money on surviving The Wedding intact.Since stumbling acrossVenus in Blue Jeans: Konigsburg, Texas Book 1when it was offered as a free Kindle download on Amazon.com, I've become totally addicted to the town and inhabitants of Konigsburg, Texas, and thoroughly pleased with Meg Benjamin as an author. With a smooth, crisp writing style that highlights the strength of the series - the quirky characters that populate Konigsburg - and makes the narrative flow surprisingly well with whatever crazy situations those characters find themselves, Benjamin has a gem of a series on her hands. As I was withVenus in Blue Jeans, I was surprised and impressed with just how quick and fun a read Wedding Bell Blues is, and credit the author for both the fluidity of the narrative and the charm of the characters and setting.I liked Pete and Janie - perhaps not quite as much as Cal and Docia, but still they were a pleasure to read about. I don't think Pete's character was quite as well developed in the beginning of this book as Cal's had been in his, so the evolution of Pete's character from sourpuss jerk to nice guy was a bit subtle, but I enjoyed the results all the same. The Wedding is a good foil for the book, though the insular nature of wedding preparations did slightly diminish the role of the town and townspeople as the forces of nature they were in the first book. What it provided, however, was a surprisingly realistic and occasionally tragic conflict with the Toleffson and Dupree families' dynamic.There was little smooth about that dynamic. With one brother whose wife is a vapid trollop with the maternal instinct most cobras would envy, a mother who disapproves of everything and anything, and an eldest brother with far too much bad history to forgive, Pete's family was pretty much nightmarish. I didn't much care for the mother or the sister-in-law, but thought it was great storytelling. Janie's got some conflict with her mother over the guy she's seeing and she allows herself to be a bit of a doormat in a couple of places when being nice didn't serve her very well, but I actually know people just like her so there was definitely a sense of realism to her character.As much as I wish a couple of the less than pleasant people in the book got more of a comeuppance, I appreciated the story as a whole and was thrilled to see the direction it's taking. I had a bit of an issue in the previous book with the speed with which Cal and Docia got together, and for my personal preferences, the relationship between Pete and Janie developed in a far more pleasing time frame, right up until the end. There was a massive leap in development towards the end that seemed abrupt and precipitous, but overall I enjoyed the entirety of their relationship.I thinkVenus in Blue Jeanswas a bit more quirky in both character and story, and just a touch more charming because of it, but Wedding Bell Blues was a more complex tale that provided more depth with the familial issues and in my personal opinion, was more realistic with an overall better plot. I've become a huge fan of Benjamin and this series and am looking forward to continuing withBe My Baby: Konigsburg, Texas, Book 3. I've enjoyed the Toleffsons and love the town and people of Konigsburg.

When he meets an incredibly sexy brunette who rocks his world in an all-too-brief erotic encounter, Carson is left wanting more...and wanting her.Holly Lawson doesn't have time for relationships.  She just broke up with a demanding ex, she wants to start her own restaurant, and her family members are constantly getting themselves into trouble.  A one-night stand is just what she needed.  Then said one-night stand shows up at a wedding she's catering and Holly finds she can't resist the attraction between them.  But where she wants a fling, Carson wants a relationship.  Holly's about to learn just how determined one sexy SEAL can be.One thing's for sure - Heat of Passion is hot, hot, HOT!  Elle Kennedy delivers a wonderful romance that'll make you smile even as it makes you sweat.I first fell in love with Carson in the first Out of Uniform story, Heat of the Moment.  With his sensual, charming exterior and the caring soul that lies beneath, how can one not fall in love with Carson?  He is everything worth drooling over, so it's easy to find why Holly found him impossible to resist.  As for the woman who catches the heart of said playboy?  Holly is a bright, loving soul who has been burned by a past relationship gone sour.  Her fears of giving all of herself in a full-fledged relationship are understandable, but I really enjoyed watching Carson try to break through to her.While Heat of Passion is the second book in the Out of Uniform series, each story fully stands on its own.  However, fans of Heat of the Moment will no doubt delight in seeing Carson's best friend, Garrett, and his bride Shelby once more.  Heat of Passion also gives readers a little insight into Lieutenant Will Charleston whose story I am now aching for and I will be rushing to read his story, Heat of the Storm, very shortly.A passionate, engaging story that I could not put down, I cannot say enough good things about Heat of Passion or Ms. Kennedy's work.

Who doesn't want that?The idea of mind mapping is that it helps you organise ideas. So instead of taking notes line by line, the idea is to place the central theme or keyword in the middle of the page and add more keywords surrounding it, with lines drawn between them to represent their relationships.According to this book (and now I know, it definitely makes sense!), mind mapping makes you more effective because this method is more compatible with the brain. This is because it matches how the brain functions biologically. Mind mapping also engages both halves of your brain at once, making you much more efficient and effective.A key poi nt, and one very important to me personally is that mind mapping is supposed to enhance creativity. As a writer, there are few skills which are more important! I imagine many writers would find mind mapping a very useful way of planning out their work, linking together various ideas, characters and plot points.As the book says, it'll be difficult to break my habit of making linear notes and the mind mapping will take practice. I've only really covered how I personally will find mind mapping useful, but the book covers a wide variety of ways in which it helps people, for example; note taking, brainstorming, collaborative writing, problem resolution and more.So if you're looking for a way to make your planning and note-taking go more smoothly and effectively, then this book is ideal.","03 4, 2011",A2L3ZY42HQY5FL,Lucy Felthouse,An excellent resource,1299196800

United by their love for one woman and determined to carry on her cause the men are at a point in their lives where they're ready to make some changes - after all they can't bring back Rebeccah by killing themselves supporting her cause.  Neither would have guessed that they'd find a new reason to make their Rocky Mountain cabin a home courtesy of a beautiful creature who captures their attention.Kaya, a cougar shifter, has lived with very little human interaction but something draws her to Hunter and Jericho's cabin.  At first she only watches the men from a distance and enjoys their scent but injured and in need of a place to rest, she makes the decision to trust them and enters their home.  Despite her attraction to the men, Kaya isn't ready to trust them with her secret - but she's unable to resist the idea of a cooked meal and shifts once she believes the men are asleep for the night.Hunter and Jericho are confused about the young woman's appearance in their cabin.  What's she doing there wearing only Jericho's discarded shirt?  From her reaction to being discovered inhaling food it's obvious she's terrified and that only increases their curiosity about her.  When she bolts from the house they pursue her and bring her back - after all they can't leave a naked woman alone in the snow-covered mountains.Both men are attracted to Kaya and protecting her is a priority.  They've never encountered anyone like her before but aren't exactly ready to share another woman either.  How are they going to handle learning about her shifter abilities or the isolated life she's led?  There's a world of difference between them.  Can it be overcome?  And what happens when Hunter and Jericho get called out on an assignment and must leave Kaya behind?Maya Banks delivers yet another captivatingly emotional read that promises to stay in your memory long after you've finished reading the final page of AMBER EYES.  Hunter, Jericho and Kaya have deep-seated fears and issues which have dictated how they handle situations.  Trust doesn't come easy for any of them but with a lot of patience, understanding and love they all have the possibility of finding happiness together.  AMBER EYES is one of those stories that draws the reader into the plot, allows you to fall in love with the characters and warms your heart with each new revelation.  I smiled, worried, laughed, agonized and cried along with the characters and wanted nothing more than for them to all have a happily-ever-after.

4185,359,B000JQUSBQ,"[3, 4]",5,"Fairy tales are usually thought of as children's literature, and in terms of how much children in particular are fascinated with them this categorization is not without a merit. However, most good fairy tales tap into some social or personal tension, a fact of life, or a natural phenomenon. They often take rather ordinary situations and push them to the limit of what our imagination considers plausible. Fairy tales are thus a form of reductio ad absurdum of common sense, and they often help us see various life situations in terms of their most basic principles. This is why fairy tales have had, and continue to have, a lot of fascination with adults as well.Most of us have grown up with fairy tales of Hans Christian Andersen or Brothers Grimm. There is a sort of cannon of western fairy tales that have become part of the common patrimony of the entire world - Little Red Riding Hood, Snow White, Rapunzel, and many others. However, these fairy tales are only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the European fairy tales, and the World literature is even more filled with beautiful, unusual and imaginative stories.This collection of the Indian fairy tales is as great of a collection of fairy tales as they come. It is rather fascinating to see that even thought many fairy tales reflect certain Indian cultural norms, the basic structure and the motifs are surprisingly familiar. We have villains and heroes charged with an unusual and demanding task, monsters and talking animals are everywhere, there are damsels-in-distress aplenty, and most tales take place ""long, long, time ago."" All of the tales are very well written and the language is crisp and contemporary.

You might want to call it ""Sissy puss"" and then blush about it, roll your eyes, or laugh, but I can tell you now, this book is no joke. I would say Patricia Halloff's book now ranks in the top five books of all I have read this year.If you are an animal lover, even if you are not; if you have a beating heart that society hardens from time to time, and you yearn for some emotion to remind you just how fragile life really is sometimes, how life could be much worse for you, then I encourage you to sit and spend a night with this book. It is some of the most brilliant, heartfelt, poignant writing that I have read in some time.The name of the book comes from the Greek myth of Sisyphus, a king whose punishment was to roll a large boulder up a hill endlessly, only to have to watch it roll back down. Doomed to repeat this process over and over again throughout eternity, the word sisyphean is often used to described a task that is unending, pointless, and repetitive. Now, think about those words for a moment and think about how perfect they are as descriptions of stray pets, cats and dogs left on the streets to fend for themselves. They fight for food and shelter, fending off prey and sickness, often running away from the hands of abusive owners. Yep, it's a cruel world and the abuse is unending. Enter Sisypuss.From page one, when Sisypuss is born to a sickly mother who is near death , we are shown a grim world with no hope in sight. The entire book is told from the point-of-view of Sisypuss the cat and his outlook on the sinister unforgiving world. Think of the skinny cat you've seen in the alley behind your house, or the animal shelter you pass every day on the way to work. Think of the animal testing facilities that we deny exist. Ms. Halloff leaves no stone unturned when it comes to the harsh reality of the way animals are treated in this country. It is very real. It is no Greek myth.Being an animal lover myself and owning two cats, I have to admit this book is not the happy fairytale cliche I was probably expecting. It is, however, a wake up call that the treatment of animals is something we should be concerned about.  Those of you who may not like books with animals as the central characters, don't stop reading now.There are humans in this story, but their central existence as secondary characters only serves the purpose of showing the relationship between humans and animals, as pets, and the delicate boundaries between our world and theirs.  But again, these plot lines are no walk in the park.  Booley, Sisypuss's main owner, is battling drug use.There is an array of other characters, both human and animal, that will definitely keep the pages turning.  At times, Halloff's vivid writing will leave a coppery taste in your mouth.  Your chest will hurt from your heart crying out.  You may even hang your head in shame for not doing anything to help our furry friends.  But above all this, you will come away from this book never once regretting the time you spent reading it.  You will learn something, and hopefully we'll make change.  Bravo to Patricia Halloff because her clever and informative writing demands that change!","08 17, 2008",A3II7VQOJ0Q1XD,"Shannon L.

This story has strong characters who bring interesting plots to the storylines with issues such as homelessness, sexual abuse, rape, torture, special abilities and paranormal; a story that is so unpredictable.This is a book/storyline where you need and open mind, this is not an easy read.  You need to go back few pages in order to catch the idea, the meaning of what you just read.  Even if the storyline is about Jesse and Sarah who are about 17 years old, this is adult material.  Is this reality or hallucination?  Is this reality or parallel planes?  I really enjoyed this book and I would tremendously enjoy a sequel.I just downloaded &#8220;Corvus&#8221; of the same author.  I hope it will bring me as much pleasure as Mortal Ghost did.","06 9, 2014",AJR0I0B9DEFF3,Nicole,Intense and powerful,1402272000

3803,5938,B002HJV45C,"[2, 2]",5,"I always liked T.A. Chase's work, I believe he is one of the first authors I read, but this last book probably is one of my favorite; the first impression I have soon after ending it, is of a very easy and well plotted book, once that despite being almost 200 pages long took me only a night to read since I was eager to know what was happening.The second impression is the play of contrast, that the author uses in two different way: once between the two main characters, Garrett, an Hollywood actor, and C.J., a race driver; from their jobs and from the fact that C.J. was apparently straight and also older than Garrett (even if only for 4 years), you will expected C.J. to be the MAN in the relationship. Yes I know, I'm letting old habit and idea to lead me on, but well, I'm not the only one! Even if you are reading a male on male romance, if you are strong, older, and with a more manly job, you are the MAN. And instead in the relationship, Garrett takes the upper hand: he is the one who shelters and offers a friendly shoulder to C.J. when no one else apparently is willing to do it; and when C.J. is ready to admit that he is gay and wants to come out of the closet, Garrett is more than willing to be his training ship and to teach him everything a good and healthy gay man should know ; and here is when the naughty part of the book is coming, but strangely enough, is not the main aspect of the story, and it's not even so soon in the book, you have to savor it.The second contrast I notice was in C.J.'s parents, and again my old fashioned idea kicked in to make me having the wrong mind. Usually mothers are more accepting and supporting, they are the ones who try to mediate with their husbands and sons when the truth comes out (pun intended). And even more in this case, where C.J.'s parents are old southern people and his father is a mechanic, not usually a job that allows people to be very open minded (why on earth when we are speaking of car and motor, it seems that women and gays are not enough clever to be involved?). Anyway, I was in for a big surprise when it was C.J.'s father who stood for his son when on the other side his mother kicked him out of house.This are only two example to prove you that the story, as I said, is very well plotted and carefully crafted in every details. Plus the characters have a good development, enough for the reader to identify himself and try to imagine how it would be for him of he was in their shoes.Last but not least, I really like as T.A. Chase seems to have done his homework right: the car racing world, even if only hinted, is enough vivid to give the reader the impression to be not only a nice cover for the main character: this is something I noticed before in this author's books, there is often a sport setting (baseball, rodeo, horse jumping and now car racing) and they are always rendered with nice details to help the reader building the world in his mind. So, two are the things, or T.A. Chase is an huge sport fan, or he does well his research work.Only one regret: I would have liked to read about the Academy Awards night, hope to see it in a third book?","12 2, 2009",A1E481YU3ZPK6S,Elisa,High Line (Love of Sports 2) by T.A.

641,1093,B0011ECV42,"[15, 16]",5,"Question: How does an extraterrestrial civilization survive the impending destruction of its home planet?Answer: Embed your species' DNA in meteors and send them flying throughout the galaxy in hopes that eventually one of the meteors will impact on a planet that is suitable for regeneration of the species.That's the scenario for Robert Williams' first rate science fiction novel ""Peculiar, MO."" The story reminded me a bit of a cross between ""Andromeda Strain"" and ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers,"" but in fact it's neither. In ""Andromeda Strain,"" the action takes place primarily at a remote laboratory where scientists study the alien organism that has infected and killed most of a small town's population. In ""Peculiar, MO,"" the action is in the town itself and centers around the organism's effects on the local people and a biological terrorism military unit that is studying the alien organism and trying to limit its spread. The tension grows steadily as the unit's scientist comes to the terrifying realization that the organism is attempting to invade the earth, not just infect it.The author's scientific explanation of the mechanism by which the alien plasmids (short strands of DNA) could use earth's plants and animals, including humans, to regenerate the alien species and rebuild its group consciousness and memory is quite detailed. I don't remotely have enough science background to know how plausible this is, but it was a fascinating concept that was more credible than the typical aliens-invade-human-bodies stories. I'll give the author a lot of credit for originality.The author builds the story around several characters. The principal characters, including Kelly Ross, Spencer Dale, and the mysterious John Gordon, are likable, well developed three-dimensional characters. There are some bad guys too, and the author kills them off in some very satisfying (i.e., gruesome) ways.As another reviewer noted, the military unit involved in the story was very small and was led by a non-commissioned officer, with privates doing most of the work. This wasn't very realistic, since the government had already dealt with a previous meteor strike that contained the alien plasmids, so the potential danger was recognized. I'm guessing that the author's reasoning was that a larger unit, such as a battalion, would have brought too much attention from the local people. In any case, this is a fairly minor quibble.Having read other stories by Robert Williams, I expected the writing to be of professional quality, and it was. The story flowed smoothly from scene to scene, and the characters' dialog was realistic. The story grabbed me from the beginning, and the action is pretty much nonstop, ending in an extremely tense and violent climax. Blended smoothly into the action is the relationship between Kelly and Spencer and the blossoming romance that brings them closer together.Editing was generally good, but there were a number of typos in my Kindle version. There weren't enough mistakes to affect my enjoyment of the book, but the author should have proofread his final manuscript more closely.No spoilers here, but after reading ""Peculiar, MO,"" I don't know if I'll ever turn my back on a cat again!The bottom line: This is a first rate page-turner for science fiction and techno-thriller fans. It's certainly one of the most original and intelligently written alien invasion stories I've read.","12 10, 2009",A1E1LEVQ9VQNK,J. Chambers,Invasion of the Plasmids!,1260403200

Alexa wasn't going to let him ruin this for her with his cruel games.When the meeting concluded, Alexa couldn't get out of there fast enough after confronting Justin about their steamy encounter.  She raced home to cool off, but as she gathered her briefcase from the car, a man grabbed her from behind and jabbed a gun in her back.  She tried to struggle and get away, but he had her.  Alexa thought it was over until someone came to help in response to her screams for help.  The next thing she knew she was in another car with a rugged looking Justin tending to her wounds, and the intense businessman she had just met driving.  She demanded to know what was going on, and was flabbergasted to learn she was in the presence of Jason and Justin Winston - twin brothers.What a steamy suspenseful ride!!  There is story with intense passion, and together that always makes a winner.  Jason is a strong controlled dominant man while his twin is laid back taking things moment by moment.  Jason and Justin know immediately that Alexa was the woman for them, but she has been hurt in the past, and isn't as easily convinced.","11 19, 2008",A1OGPR0AKZ4K7D,"Kelly ""Reviewer for The Sinfully Sensuous""",Nice and Naughty,1227052800

So, while this download here is only the one story, and a short one at that, it is more than enough story.Told in first person, a woman remembers a time in her life when she was young and had time to waste and time for mistakes. An old stack of black and white photos brings back memories of when the narrator was twenty-two and maybe reckless. She decided on an adventure, leaving Connecticut for the unknown- the South, and there, the ""wide-eyed Yankee college girl"" met a man twice her age. She began a relationship with Tommy, and if that was love, it was dysfunctional.Just as the narrator and Tommy are characters in this story, the South is there, too, in all its natural beauty and man-made ugliness, serving as a mirror for Tommy, for those good and dark parts of him. Just like Tommy, nothing in this place ""was what it seemed, nothing was permanent, and so much was concealed."" After I finished this story, I kept thinking about it, about those people and places who have hidden truths and old ghosts, about those wrong turns we take in life and the lessons they teach us.There is so much depth to this story. It is written in such a masterful way, with complete control of language, no word unnecessary, no word contrived, just wonderfully well-written in every way. This is what a short story can and should be-- complete, short but substantial, and layered with meaning and feeling. To me, this story was brilliantly done.","11 17, 2011",A37J3XRX1TENTS,S.

My Kindle edition of the initial issue offered included 9 short stories, including a great Lawrence Block ""Keller"" story and a new English translation of a wonderful Japanese mystery set in the world of the Japanese police. There was also a short review column on mystery blogs and a meaty, interesting book review column.  The issue was rounded out by a nice reproduction of the print edition's cover, two cute poems (crime-oriented, of course), and announcement of the magazine's 2007 Reader Awards.At the end of each story, one is given the option to jump back to the table of contents to select another story, but I chose to just sail right through and read the whole edition ""cover to cover"".  That's something I never did with the print edition for some reason.  I guess just seeing one nicely presented page at a time on the Kindle versus seeing one big intimidating digest all at once makes all the difference for us readers who battle an occasional lazy streak.I'll likely check out one or two other Dell magazines offered on the Kindle.  It was a nice diversion from the regular reading of my Kindle novel and news blogs to enjoy a piece of short fiction every day or so (I made this first issue last about two weeks).  But, whatever other Dell titles I end up trying out, Ellery Queen Mystery Magazine is likely to be the one ongoing, regular visitor to my Kindle each month.Note: Amazon frequently updates the presentation the functionality of Kindle blogs and periodicals, so as this review gets older, it may no longer accurately describe the current version of this product.","05 22, 2008",A3GRN6J64F2C3X,"Joseph P.

Yes, Laney is very much like an uke in a traditional yaoi story - but, I like yaoi.  He is a little effeminate, which may seem stereotypical, but there are men like this. Certainly not all gay men, or even all ""bottoms.""  Yet, I rarely see readers griping about how so many romances have strong, handsome men either - why aren't they short and ugly to avoid being stereotypical? Because this is a fantasy romance not real life!  Laney's clumsiness is a little over the top, but his relationship with Dev is sweet and hot.  I would have liked the characters to be more developed, but this is a short story not a novel.

Although it is a short read, the author draws her characters fully, and you feel that you understand them very well in their struggle to cope with their relationship and their uncertain directions in life.

I LOVED this short story to pieces!!!Erik is in love with Devin and has asked her to move in with him. Devin, afraid of living the hellish life her parents lived, is gun shy when it comes to commitment and decides moving in with Erik is going too far too fast so she dumps him.The chase and capture is funny as all get out! Devin finally relents under what I can only describe as the sexiest, most sensually erotic siege it has ever been my honor to behold. I wish I could give this more stars.Well done!**BEST READ: with a glass of Blackberry Merlot and chocolate dipped strawberries! Have your little black book handy, you might need to call in reinforcements LOL!!!","04 9, 2012",A3764BVZPCASBH,EnvyNone,Wickedly Erotic and Sexy!!!,1333929600
